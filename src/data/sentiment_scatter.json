It is mainly understood as meaning people who are particularly nationalist, typically in a way that sees to openly value their own nationality above others.\n\nYet, nationalism is in truth extremely prevalent, across almost the whole political spectrum, and on every level in society. People ask a foreign-seeming person where they come from to learn their *true* nationality, everyone must have a nationality associated with them in our record-keeping systems, rhetoric drawing from nationalism is prevalent among all parliamentary politics no matter the party (\"We fight for the brighter future for Americans!\", a statement basically any American politician could put out).\n\nNationalism has become so internalized and so presupposed and so naturalized that there isn't even a word left to describe it.\n\nThat, to me, is alarming and sad. For that to change, somehow, it should be once again made obvious that chauvinist nationalism and this sort of \"hidden\", everyday, unnamed nationalism are basically simply the same thing of different strengths.\n\nMichael Billig coined the term \"banal nationalism\" for this. But I doubt that's a term that's going to see much use; *banal* is also negative.\n\nInstead, what I think might be good would be to just commonly and often call this out as what it is - nationalism. No tippy-toeing, if an argument or a rhetoric or a phrase is rooted in nationalist thinking or presupposes nation states, we call it what it is - nationalism."},{"created_date":"2025-02-16T12:40:06.000","sentiment_score":-0.946233809,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Will there be partisan groups in future wars?

After the Russian Revolution, communism became a concrete, real-world system associated with centralized authoritarian states like the Soviet Union.

It\u2019s completely contradictory to attach anarchism\u2014a philosophy of anti-authoritarianism\u2014to a term that has become synonymous with government control.\n\nThe reality is that modern leftist and activist groups have co-opted anarchism, blending it into a vague, trendy brand of \u201canti-capitalism\u201d that serves their own agenda.

I had to run the old words of the durruti group through a PC AI to soften and tone down the 1930s anarchist lanuage to  be more sensitive and anti-oppressive ironically.\n\nThe collapse of an anarchist revolution that had everything in its favor was a pivotal moment. The Durruti group identified key structural weaknesses and sought to address them to prevent similar failures in future anarchist movements.\n\nThey followed apolitical theories to their logical conclusion and recognized a critical issue: the absence of political decision-making structures necessary for the coordination necessary to sustain the revolution.\n\nIn 1938, they proposed a program with a strategic adjustment to anarchism. How influential have their insights and warnings been on contemporary 21st-century anarchist thought in the West?\n\nOur Programme\nRevolutions cannot succeed without clear objectives and direction. The July Revolution demonstrated this shortcoming\u2014while the CNT had the strength, it lacked a cohesive plan to channel revolutionary energy. Leaders were caught off guard and uncertain about how to proceed. The result was hesitation at a moment when decisive action was essential, ultimately leading to the revolution\u2019s loss.\n\nThese critical junctures leave no room for uncertainty. There must be a clear path forward. We aim to address this gap, ensuring that the lessons of July and May are never repeated.\n\nTo this end, we propose a strategic modification to anarchism: the establishment of a Revolutionary Junta.\n\nThe revolution requires organized bodies to oversee and defend it against hostile elements. Experience has shown that opposition will not simply fade away\u2014it must be confronted. While some anarchist comrades may have ideological concerns, the reality of events demands that we take a firm stance.\n\nIf we wish to avoid repeating past mistakes, we must act decisively against forces that do not align with the interests of the working class.\n\nKey Proposals:\n1. Establishment of a Revolutionary Junta or National Defense Council.\n\nThis body will be formed through democratic elections within union organizations. Consideration will be given to those at the front, ensuring their right to representation.\nThe Junta will not interfere in economic matters, which remain under union control.\nFunctions of the Junta include:\nCoordinating defense and managing the war effort.\nMaintaining revolutionary stability.\nHandling international affairs.\nConducting revolutionary outreach.\nPositions will rotate regularly to prevent entrenchment, with trade union assemblies exercising oversight.\n2. Economic Power to the Syndicates.\n\nSince July, unions have demonstrated their ability to manage economic production effectively. Their role must be fully recognized and elevated.\nAn Economic Council, aligned with industrial federations, may be established to enhance coordination.\n3. Free Municipality.\n\nBefore foreign rule, Spain had a strong tradition of municipal autonomy. This decentralized model must be revived to prevent the formation of a new state system.\nIn the new society, governance will be handled by local municipalities, supported by unions. Since all members of society will be producers, there will be no inherent conflicts of interest.\nMunicipalities will be organized into local, regional, and national federations, maintaining strong ties with the unions at every level.\nTowards a Fresh Revolution."},{"created_date":"2025-02-14T06:18:20.000","sentiment_score":-0.9962559938,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"I Can't Find Hope in Anarchy I'm two years out of highschool and studying at a community college. My father has been a blue collar worker his whole life and made it known to me that I'll regret it if I led the life he did in construction, and in the mill. Every since 9th grade, though I was slightly conservative then, I despised the idea of work. Not work in itself, but a life of work, because to me life felt antithetical to it. Now, as I'm receiving an education, I feel more and more despair reading the news and seeing the state of the world. Reading history of stateless and\/or horizontal societies don't bring me much hope either. I just want to live in a world where whatever work I do feels important, like it fulfills a purpose, as this one makes it feel almost worthless. \n\nToday I was planning to join a group reading, at a local anarchist collective (unlucky, an ice storm hit), but mostly for finding community. I suppose the point of this post is that I'm feeling anarchism, or any other anti-capitalist movement for that matter, is a lost cause considering how dominant our economic and political structures are. Learning about the world only depresses me more. So, why should I feel anarchism will gain any wider engagement, or at least enough to be effective?

I hope this post finds you well and with some nourishment and loved ones bringing colour into your life.  I wanted to inquire with this sub about some existential questions I am having regarding my own life path, and I guess a request for some advice.\n\nI am a white settler (30m) currently living in a city where I've been for the past 6 years.  I was not born here but I have developed many good relationships here with people, projects, and the land.  I spent my first 4 years here involved in activism and advocacy, particularly regarding housing justice, until I 'burned out' and my energy output became unsustainable.  Since that time two years ago, I've been struggling to reorient my life path towards meaningful, longterm projects.  The reality of rent, food prices, traffic congestion, etc. is, of course, fairly suffocating. I have found my own ways to manage but systemically I don't have faith in things getting better.\n\nPresently, I have some good friends living in a rural area 2 hours from the city, who would gladly welcome me into their community.  Most amenities are 15-45 minutes away but there is plentiful access to land, and good soil for farming\/gardening.  I have access to an offgrid land project with dear friends where we could live ruggedly and supporting one another.  There are many enticing things about this rural life: the directness of growing my own food, fetching my own water, firewood, building structures from scraps, doing all of this with friends. But I have some hangups.  Namely, I feel that I would be \"cashing in\" on my whiteness and intergenerational wealth in a way that compromises my values, i.e. prioritizing my own comfort over vulnerable strangers, inevitably dedicating a higher proportion time &amp; energy to off-grid chores, driving, etc.  Of course there would be the possibility of developing more relationships with locals and creating mutual aid projects.  And even though it is a very white region, there are historic Black and Indigenous communities \\~30-40 minutes away that I could develop more of a relationship with. Ultimately, I'm struggling to shake the idea that \"the city\" is where I should be because of it's density of \"important frontlines of social struggle,\" and I also really enjoy its internationalist nature, density of young people, sometimes night-life...\n\nPerhaps my internal conflict of \"anarchism in the city vs. the country\" is unnecessarily dualistic, yet it feels true that they are very different lifestyles.   With the reduced stress of living rurally (rent-free baby!) I would enjoy dedicating more time to writing, researching, and possibly even publishing anarchist histories.  Other than that I don't exactly have a skilled trade, but I have made myself handy for carpentry &amp; construction jobs in the past.\n\nAny resources, insights, or experiences you feel compelled to share would be greatly beneficial to me.  I appreciate you taking time to read this.  In solidarity !"},{"created_date":"2025-02-11T15:14:27.000","sentiment_score":-0.9350636005,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Neurodivergent, disabled, care leaver and youth anarchist trapped in academia: an italian educational odyssey \"TL;DR: I need formal education and credentials to survive and eventually reform\/overthrow the system, but I deeply oppose its reductionist, oppressive, and anti-neurodivergent approach. I want libertarian education that embraces doubt, critical thinking, and diverse ways of knowing. Currently trapped between institutional survival and my anarchist epistemology, looking for perspectives on navigating this contradiction without losing myself in the process.\"\n\nI've been doing exhausting research and reading several posts about education in this subreddit.\n\nI'm new here and I'm mainly looking for like-minded people, who are so rare to meet in Italy.\n\nI've always been an unorthodox student. I live in Italy, I'm autistic and gifted, and I live with a chronic disabling condition. I have no family. My autistic condition has made me particularly devoted to science, and over the years my reflections and way of thinking have naturally drawn me closer to anarchist thought, particularly its ecological and communitarian current. Perhaps I'm more anarchist than I realize!\n\nThroughout my life journey, I have experienced systematic discrimination and abuse, istitutional too: at university, in high school, and in the communities where I lived as a minor. My unconventional way of thinking, giftedness, political practices, and specific needs related to my atypicality were certainly catalyzing elements of these experiences of marginalization and violence. These continuous social pressure and discrimination have led me to develop deep depression.\n\nI consider anarchism as a possible foundation for an ethical epistemological paradigm that aspires to overcome fragmented, reductionist knowledge. My passion for study and reading, which I experience as acts of subversion, has progressively distanced me from contemporary institutions. In ten years of professional experience across public, private, cooperatives, and NGOs, I have observed how neoliberal ideology and kyriarchy have corrupted ideals, principles, and projects at every level, especially in Italy.\n\nCurrently, I do a job I love - I dedicate myself, besides obsessive studying, to advocacy and support for young people who grew up without families - but it's economically undervalued. I live in poverty. In our country, which I deeply love for its language, food, climate, and geography, working conditions for neurodivergent and disabled people are extremely problematic. I also strongly oppose English as a lingua franca (I'm sorry for native-english), both for socio-political reasons and due to my neurodivergent needs. Therefore, leaving Italy is not the most immediate option for me.\n\nI've enrolled in university to continue my studies, but I'm increasingly convinced that mass education pursues objectives far from learning quality and the development of critical thinking and autonomy - fundamental elements for forming individuals capable of contributing to their own, their community and nature's well-being. The degree appears increasingly necessary, but the meritocratic competition for scholarships, combined with the self-referential nature of the Italian system, requires conforming one's cognitive processes to a pathological system and assimilating beliefs that don't belong to me. The elimination of doubt in institutions, evidently considered subversive, is another significant issue.\n\nMy purpose is to conduct research in the sociology of institutionalized knowledge and in epistemic justic to overturn my country's educational system. I strongly believe that the way to an anti-oppressive and equitable society parts of education. However, to gain acknowledgment, credentials, and economic support (just enough to survive, haha), I must follow the institutional path.\n\nHow can I overcome this impasse?"},{"created_date":"2025-02-11T09:58:34.000","sentiment_score":-0.6965996623,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"What are the radest anarchist quotes?

Second, Trump and Musk are not tearing down the government completely, they are tearing down the things standing in the way of their ability to amass more power and more money. Third, Anarchy is not a top-down process. Without the bottom up approach where communities are built upon mutual trust and mutual aid, the swift removal of parts of the US government can only lead to greater chaos. With the bottom up approach, communities learn to work together in mutually beneficial ways, cooperating for the benefit of all and removing their reliance on corporations and governments. Governments would dissolve because there is no need for them, corporations would dissolve because they would be replaced by individuals cooperating for the benefit of all.

Hi everyone, I\u2019d like to start a discussion about the use of the term *fascism* and whether it remains a useful category for analyzing contemporary political phenomena from an anarchist perspective.\n\nIn many political debates today, especially within antifascist circles, the term *fascism* is frequently used to describe authoritarian right-wing projects and figures such as Trump, Bolsonaro, or Elon Musk. However, I wonder if this usage is still analytically helpful or if, on the contrary, it oversimplifies the issue and prevents a deeper understanding.\n\n**Personally, I believe that antifascism as an ethical horizon will always be relevant.** However, labeling figures like Musk or Trump as \"fascist\" seems problematic to me. Even if they share authoritarian and reactionary elements, applying this label often turns them into mere *Hollywood villains*, making it easier for them to reject the accusation and weaken the critique. Additionally, this broad use of *fascism* may prevent us from identifying the specific characteristics of today\u2019s political and economic landscape, such as **corporate capitalism** or **techno-feudalism**.\n\nAuthors like **Murray Bookchin, Peter Gelderloos, and Noam Chomsky** have criticized the indiscriminate use of the term *fascism*, arguing that applying it to any contemporary form of authoritarianism can be misleading. Instead, they suggest analyzing power structures within capitalism, colonialism, and broader hierarchical systems. (**Edit: I originally made a mistake regarding Chomsky. In fact, he does use the term** ***fascism*** **quite broadly. Thanks to a response from DvD\\_Anarchist on this post, I can now clarify this.**)\n\nSome questions I\u2019d like to explore:\n\n* To what extent does *fascism*, in its historical sense (Mussolini, Hitler, etc.), remain a valid category for understanding today\u2019s authoritarianism?\n* Does the overuse of *fascism* reduce complex political phenomena to historical comparisons instead of analyzing them in their own context?\n* From an anarchist perspective, is it more useful to focus on power structures and hierarchy in general rather than labeling certain movements as \"fascist\"?\n* What do you think of the critiques from Bookchin, Gelderloos, and Chomsky on this topic? Are there other anarchist thinkers who address this issue?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and any relevant bibliography on the subject.

We've seen this happen with capitalism and the record-breaking difference between the rich and poor, we've seen it with climate change, and we've seen it with the loss of our privacy. Right now - especially in the US - it seems like there's more interest in internet privacy than there's been in a long time, but when people look into it and find out how far we are from being truly private, they get discouraged. We're being pulled in 2 different directions: \"We can't really do anything\" and \"We can't just do nothing.\"\n\nIf that's how you feel, you're not alone. But your privacy is definitely still worth taking back.\n\n#1. Surveillance isn't free.\n\nCorporations and governments have a lot of money, energy, and computing power to track people, but it's not infinite. The most intensive types of surveillance (the ones that involve dedicated experts, complex deanonymization techniques, and things like that) are mostly saved for high-level targets like terrorists and military agents. The basic level of surveillance they do on everyone is all passive: automatically logging information about you as you live your life.\n\nAnything you do to separate yourself from their trackers stops a little of that. Doing something as simple as switching your browser to a more private one, or disabling location or Google apps on your phone, or deleting apps you don't need and logging out of social media, means 1 less source of information about your life that can be tracked.\n\nAre more serious measures worth learning and doing? Absolutely, because privacy is freedom. The more dissenting, threatening to power, or targeted you are, the more private you need to be. But it's not all-or-nothing, and you can get better at it over time.\n\nEspecially because of the second reason:\n\n#2. Information goes out of date.\n\nIt's a common belief that once your information is out there, there's no use protecting it. But almost everything about you changes over time, so if someone stops being able to track you, eventually what they know about you will be less useful. Maybe you don't go to the same places or talk to the same people as you used to. Maybe your beliefs and opinions changed. Maybe you have a different job, a different computer or phone, a different bank account or card than you did before. For all they know, maybe you changed your name and moved out of the country. Each piece of information you keep someone from getting is information that might not be true anymore.\n\nOne big exception is your DNA, which is why everyone should stay away from things like 23andMe and Ancestry.\n\n#3. Privacy is a community effort.\n\nStaying private would be impossible if you were the only one doing it. If everyone is leaving their data out in the open and you're the only one keeping it secret, you'll stand out more than anyone else - but if everyone is securing their privacy, it's there for people who need it most. And secure messages, group chats, and file sharing are only secure if *everyone* keeps that information safe.\n\nPlus, privacy is only accessible because of open-source projects and the people who develop them, almost always for free, as well as those who learn privacy and security so they can help each other with it. Without that, only the best security experts could keep their data private.\n\nAnd in a worst-case scenario, if *everything* goes wrong and they catch you doing something that really pisses them off, there's nothing like people you can trust around you, who will have your back and not snitch on you, and will remember you and visit you in jail if it comes to that.\n\nThe ultimate point of surveillance is fear, because without fear it's hard to control someone.\n\nSo let's take our control back, little by little."},{"created_date":"2025-02-08T23:56:28.000","sentiment_score":-0.9639214277,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Does anyone else here actually love the writings of Marx and Engels but profoundly disagree with most Marxists\/Leninists\/Maoists?

Many people point to Fox, WSJ, NYT and other dominant news sources for their direct role in \"sanewashing\" fascists, presenting horrible, democracy-ending news as normal, and generally just being propaganda. \n\nSee, the usual workaround to the liberal propaganda in recent years was independent journalism or just direct information on platforms like Twitter, TikTok, Instagram sorta and other online platforms, or relying on Google algorithms to promote their websites.

As refreshing as it\u2019s been to witness a conscientious surge, be mindful of how you let one another define class war. There\u2019s been an abundance of those who are newly radicalized, ready to become revolutionaries. Rightfully so, outrage has the masses standing on business. Those who\u2019ve been rooted should feel a responsibility to guide. Yes, there will be waves of people on the frontlines, but does it prove efficient that be your \u201cstation\u201d? \n\nI don\u2019t mean for the above to sound condescending.   Instead, a genuine plea that if you feel involved, please consider your stance. We\u2019ve long fought the rise of this becoming; many groups formed in unison. Yet, they still inflate themselves with non-existing power, desecrating all voices unaligned, whether it be as a whisper or a gaggle. The organizing took place when your core values either aligned with or urged against this chauvinistic bullshit. Throughout the era\u2019s, the fight has taken place. Strategizing is the only way we\u2019ll overcome this.\n\nIt\u2019s as though we\u2019ve become so desensitized to headlines bold with \u201cunprecedented\u201d that we\u2019re now ready to die for change. Don\u2019t allow \u201cmartyr\u201d to become hot press. Regardless of what radicalized you, do not effortlessly let radicalization become the end of you. That fight you felt is survival for all. How quickly we\u2019ll be eradicated, charging forward prepared to die if needed. No, prepare to stand your ground at all costs. Those costs being any means to protect and persevere. Ironically, we are the heritage foundation. We are in need of protecting history, arts, architecture, science, theologies, and literature. Enforcing the removal of false narratives and the rhetoric whitewashing of it all. Return culture and protect those indigenous to the practices. Understand economics and political science but refuse contributions of that knowledge to the undeserving. Make an example of how infrastructure does not equate to industrialism nor capitalism. Prove that this is all possible while prioritizing humanity.\n \nThe ideal objective is to dismantle and discard crony capitalism, kleptocracy, patriarchs, oligarchs, fascism, elitism, misogyny, racism, police state - I mean fuck, for a crew to complain that LGTBQ was too long, they\u2019ve sure pulled their fair share of the alphabet. To go against such will be tedious. An argument could be made from my \u201cabolish all government\u201d babes. Ashes too can be viewed as tiny little fragments remaining of a system now applied to the future as nothing more than a goddamn example. Just remember to go after the throats of the oppressors, not the oppressed, and be wise enough to know the difference. Still a complete cog in the system seeking fair justice and liberty for all with perhaps a sprinkle of order? You\u2019ll need to be careful with the disassembling as you\u2019re looking to reconstruct. All sides should remain open to the idea of direct democracy on some scale.\n\nThis thought became urgent to share when topics regarding 2\/5 protests became large-scale. Some of the more linear thought processes I\u2019ve witnessed debate whether it is a trap or not. The argument being that it doesn\u2019t matter; solidarity is key. I completely agree that solidarity is key and should be the fundamental. You can protest in solidarity many ways. Before you stand in front of your capital, \nBuildings ask who is defenseless and vulnerable in the neighborhood over. Did we take advice on protecting ourselves from a surveillance state while accidentally whistleblowing an ally? Did we become irrational from fear? Yes, the masses need to be in the streets standing up for what\u2019s right, but how many of us need to be in front of a building full of government officials that have done absolutely nothing aside from proving they can\u2019t read your signs nor hear your words? To most of them, you\u2019re fanatical. Take your march to the border, to neighborhoods of culture and diversity, to domestic violence shelters where they are already being attacked. Stay true to your pacifist nature if needed by supporting local communities. Read books to the children scared, bring groceries to the families hiding, be ready to stand for them while strengthening them.

I'll start by contributing what I know and what I lived, and everyone can add stuff from their own experiences. Maybe we'll disagree on some points, but it's all for giving advices to people to make sure they stay safe. (Note: Also any advices here not encouraging anyone to talk about illegal stuff online, because those advices are about \\*safety\\* and talking about illegal stuff online definitely isn't safe.)\n\nI'm not the guy with the most experience doing radical stuff during protest. But I'll still share what I have. It's mostly about \"What to do if you don't want to get arrested\", and mostly rely on being able to avoid getting stuck in complicated situations in the first place.\n\n1:  \nIn 2012 (student strike in Qu\u00e9bec), I was arrested not following a protest, but 3 months after it, because our local police had nothing else to do (Small rural city), and they wanted to file who were among the students of that specific protest in which we had blocked an exit from a public park after the prime minister came there. I wasn't even among the most radical people there at the time. I was just standing next to them, and cops happened to take my picture. It's part of what radicalized me, really. I had only stopped a guy from falling because he had been shoved by the police, and I myself tried to avoid contact with police as much as possible.\n\n\\&gt;So yeah, avoid getting close to the police because even if they don't touch you, even if you're not doing anything specifically illegal, they can find ways to arrest you if they want. Be aware of any officer further back who might be filming or taking pictures. If you spot them, (and don't want to be arrested), move away from the hot spots\n\n2:\n\nIn 2015, I went to a protest in Montreal. It was taking place just after the anarchist bookfair, and was part of the wave of student protest against austerity measures. I was at the anarchist bookstore, and saw around 50 people marching so I just joined them. I had shirts in my bag, and ski goggles, just in case.  \nThey went to up to a street, I don't remember which, I don't know Montreal enough. It was a pedestrian street for the summer, but the cops suddenly drove in with minivans, just a bit faster than the retreating protesters were running. When the protesters where moving to the sides, the minivan stopped. Cops in riot gear got out of the minivans and grabbed the students that just got out of the vans' path. I had already moved to the sides as soon as the vans had showed up. There were not enough people to go and take them back.\n\n\\&gt; Don't stay in the streets if the protest can't hold it anymore (When you don't have the critical mass anymore). Move to the sides and keep your distance.  You can only hold a spot against the police if there are many, many more of you than there are of them, and you still need good protective equipment to do so, and it won't last forever.\n\n3:\n\nA bit later, during the same protest, I followed a group of C\u00e9gep students to the front of their college. Someone came and said that many of their friends were stuck in a kettle and they wanted to do something about it. I didn't want my picture taken again, so I used the shirts and ski google to become part of the black-bloc.\n\nBut while I was following the group, we came to an intersection. The street to the left was flanked by cops. So I stayed on the right side of the group. Seeing that all the people I was with were turning left between two rows of cops, I tried to say something, but quickly just left the protest and hid behind some brick pillar in front of a commerce entrance. When looking at the street, the cops had wheeled behind the small group I was with. They were now being kettled. I turned around the city block a while, found another protester that had been separated. We left the spot, and I had them check out while I was finding an isolated spot to remove my black shirts and goggles.\n\nUnder my t-shirt, I had a white, XVIIIth century style shirt and coat whose sleeves I had rolled up under the t-shirt. The person I was with told be: \"You don't look like a protester\". That was the point.\n\n\\&gt;Learn to recognize the signs of a kettle. Have disposable clothes if you want to conceal your identity. Avoid profiling by not looking like someone who would go to protests  (I know that last one is entirely dependant on privilege, but do your best)\n\n4:\n\nA few months earlier, we had taken part in a protest in winter in my rural homecity. I had a big red and black flag. I was masked, but my clothes were very noticeable. Me and my friend of the time did the protest, nothing illegal, but we still slowed traffic which is such a crime in the eyes of rural people... Coming back from the protest, we waited at our University. After a little while, we left, passed through a little wood to my appartment, but in the street of my appartment, we got stopped by police who questionned us, illegally asked us for our names and adress saying that IF we didn't comply we would be arrested. Of course they wanted our names so they would have files on the local protestors because we're a small city and there are not a lot of us out there.\n\n\\&gt;This is the counter-example to the last trick. A mask won't save you if your clothes are still recognizable and if you don't throw away your disguise in a spot that won't be seen. Also, scout ahead, even - or should I say - ESPECIALLY after the protest. Protests ends, but there are cops working around the clock and if they want to harass protestors, they can just wait for the protest to end and target people when they go back home, isolated and vulnerable.\n\n5:  \nIn 2017, there were protests organized by racist group \"La Meute\" (wolf-pack) in Qu\u00e9bec city. A bunch of reactionnary protesting against immigration. It was around the end of november, IIRC. There was a counter-protest organized by different leftwing organizations at the same time.  \nI went there with a few friends from my small city, a 2 hour car ride away.\n\nI was dressed with a good looking coat, something someone \"professional\" would wear. I walked here and there to try and scout things a bit. I went all the way up to the rightwing protest, and then came back down to our counter-protest. When I arrived, there was already a police line pushing on counter-protestors, many of which had white traces of maalox in their face to treat the pepper spray. I was behind the police line, they were on my right. I walked up to the foot of the Qu\u00e9bec wall near the parliament.\n\nI turned right in the little park that was empty and went back toward the parliament and the counter-protestors. A bit further back, a new police line was forming, flanking the more peaceful parts of the protest.  \nI feigned innocence and asked the police to pass. They allowed me to do so.  \nI went back into the protest and warned people that a kettle was forming up. Many more liberal counter-protestors told me that it wouldn't happen there.  \nI found the people I came to Qu\u00e9bec with, and told them it was time to leave.\n\nThe kettle was forming up. Near the parliament, there is a medieval-like wall in Qu\u00e9bec, with a big door for the cars to pass through, and smaller doors on the sidewalks. A policeman with a dog was standing there. We were far enough from the rest of the protest that we didn't look like part of it.  \nA policeman on the wall told another one that we could go through. The one with the dog said we couldn't. So I told him: \"Sorry sir, but your colleague on the wall told us to go. Can we know which one we must listen to first?\" He told us \"Okay you can go\".  \nWe went and reunited with other people of our region in a small cafe, waited an hour and then left Qu\u00e9bec city.\n\nWe learned later that a few of our friends from Montreal, and one of our guy from our city, were arrested a bit further away, they were still forming a black bloc.\n\n\\&gt;Once again, if you don't have the critical mass, leave. If you see cops forming new lines on the sides of a protest, leave. Be able to become unnoticeable. Blend yourself in the crowd of ordinary people just walking by. People will say to stay in group.  \nThis is only good when standing your ground, and this can only be done if you're in numerical superiority.  \nSooner or later, the protest will scatter and cops will start targeting those smaller groups going home. Or the protest will just be kettled.\n\nYou need to know when it's starting to happen to be able to scatter and leave just before that. I'd even recommend people who decide to organize protests to adopt a \"guerilla\" style of protests: Do the protests with ordinary-looking people scouting ahead. At the first sign of cops, signal, scatter, and reconvene at another point."},{"created_date":"2025-02-03T21:37:19.000","sentiment_score":0.9438668489,"sentiment_label":"POSITIVE","text":"All Against Oppressions "},{"created_date":"2025-02-03T22:19:37.000","sentiment_score":-0.9902153015,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"[PDF] Predatory Cities by Bernadette Atuahene - Deprived \"urban areas where public officials systematically [and illegally] take property from residents\" to bolster public funds "},{"created_date":"2025-02-03T22:27:05.000","sentiment_score":0.9658651352,"sentiment_label":"POSITIVE","text":"Anarchism in America (1983 Documentary) "},{"created_date":"2025-02-03T21:59:30.000","sentiment_score":-0.9991326928,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Why aren't you salting 2\/5?

I think its easy to call for mass General strikes, but that takes a lot of planning and people would experience real harm by being out of work for what would likely need to be a multiple week strike. \n\n  \nMy proposal is this. Any left leaning person who has a mortgage should simply stop paying it. \n\n  \nThat's the elevator pitch, but more realistically the sudden loss of thousands of mortgage payments would cripple these banks. And its something that can be sustained for multiple months by the witholder. Month 1, you save $X amount of dollars. By month 2, they'll start making calls etc... Now you have $2x cash in your savings. MAYBE by month 3 they'll start making motions like they'll go to court. Maybe send a demand letter, it will be different in each state. But All in all, across each of the states, you'll likely have 3-6 months of being able to save up your mortgage payment, before they even get the courts involved. \n\n  \nNow here we are at month 6, this has become a movement (1000 people per state could be enough, but obviously more is better), banks are really feeling the pain of not having the cash, and now you all are sitting on 6 months of mortgage that you can keep as cash, (or likely will use it to help with any varrying emergencies that will spring up in the next few months of the Regime). They start moving to foreclose on these homes. Depending on your state, you could be looking at an additional 6 months to upto and beyone 24 months. Especially since we'll now be clogging the already strained court system with all of these foreclosure cases. (Most firms handling foreclosure have lowered staffing levels since the 2008-2012 US mortgage crisis, it would likely take them 1-2 years to fire back up to 2010 levels to now match the demand to even file the cases). \n\nSo, they blink. Then hey, no harm no foul, you've got the 6 months in the bank you can just bring everything current and we've had our demands met. If they don't, then as you can see, likely anyone who is fortunate to be in this situation would likely have 1-2 years to be able to weather this storm so it would likely be the Banks that crumble first. Only took about 2 weeks of witheld labor during the pandemic to realize that could make them cow. \n\n  \nWilling to workshop, but I think this could be an avenue to put pressure on the top from the middle.

For years, the far-right has been backed by massive think-tanks like Prager University and the Daily Wire, spewing propaganda and fear that has shaped the narratives of the political right, often putting trans people square in the crosshairs alongside \"Illegals\" as an easy outgroup to represent the \"degeneration\" of society.\n\n  \nThe Right has formed a cult of personality around Trump, swallowing wholesale the red scare propaganda over the \"Communist\" Democrats, all while the Democrats gleefully skip behind them, trying to imitate them and pleasing absolutely no one. I only advocate for participating in Capitalist Democracy to keep the worst reactionaries out of power, as it's foolish to think the Democrats will stand up for anyone but the Capitalist class.\n\n\n\nBut as we've seen, when the Democrats fail to commit to standing up for human rights, giving wishy-washy none-answers like \"I'll follow the law\", people stay home. And when people stay home, the MAGA cult flocks out in droves to make their [idolatrine](https:\/\/genius.com\/Ghost-idolatrine-lyrics) the law of the land, further erasing human rights and enforcing Christian Nationalist brand Fascism.\n\n  \nThis brings me to my point about Anarchism. The simple truth of the matter is that we need more propaganda, more art, more literature, to drag this world kicking and screaming toward a better future. Already, mega entertainment corps like Disney are erasing overt trans representation in media to please their bigoted shareholders, walking back on the bare minimum token representation they already had.\n\n  \nWe cannot let the far-right [control the conversation](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CaPgDQkmqqM) any more than they already have.

Some argue that this is a way to \u201cpractice what they preach,\u201d but I see a contradiction that\u2019s worth addressing.\n\nAnarchy, at its core, is about rejecting hierarchical control, state authority, and the structures that uphold oppression. Governments exist to maintain power over people, and their systems are designed to sustain themselves, not to be dismantled from within. So when someone claims to be an anarchist while actively working in government, it raises an important question: **Are they truly practicing anarchist ideals, or are they just participating in the very system they claim to oppose?**\n\nNow, I understand that survival under capitalism requires compromise. Many of us take jobs within systems we don\u2019t fully align with because we need to pay bills, get healthcare, or navigate the reality we were born into. There\u2019s no shame in that. But let\u2019s be honest, there\u2019s a difference between working a job to survive and working for the government while claiming to resist it.\n\nIf your paycheck comes from an institution built on oppression, you\u2019re **reinforcing** that institution\u2019s existence, whether intentionally or not. You can believe you\u2019re making a difference, but real systemic change doesn\u2019t come from within systems designed to preserve themselves. Governments don\u2019t allow people to hold real power unless it serves their function. That\u2019s why historically, even well-intended reformists end up constrained by the structures they work within.\n\nWith the growing threats we\u2019re facing, environmental collapse, increased surveillance, rising authoritarianism, we don\u2019t need more people trying to \u201cfix\u201d a system that was never meant to serve us. We need more people turning their backs on it entirely. Saying no more to oppressive laws, exploitative labor, and a system that actively works against us. We spend so much of our time, energy, and resources feeding a machine that is trying to kill us. Imagine what could happen if that energy was redirected into something better.\n\nI\u2019m not telling people what to do, everyone has to make their own choices. But personally, I believe the future isn\u2019t in reforming or working within the system. It\u2019s in walking away from it. In creating something new, something prosperous, something that actually serves us. A world where we invest in each other, not in a dying system that was built to control us.\n\nWe all exist within oppressive systems, but how we engage with them matters. The question isn\u2019t just **what we do**, but ***why***, and whether our choices are truly moving us toward liberation, or just making it easier to exist within the system as it is."},{"created_date":"2025-02-02T12:36:20.000","sentiment_score":-0.9994713664,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Accidental anarchy "},{"created_date":"2025-02-02T12:54:28.000","sentiment_score":0.9658728838,"sentiment_label":"POSITIVE","text":"Wikipedia is also a goldmine for anarchist history in countries often not discussed In my experience, anarchists have a strong bias towards discussing its own history in France, the USA, Russia, Ukraine and Spain (that isn't to say these histories aren't important!)

My real mom had killed rattlesnakes when I was a kid to protect us. One time, she sliced one into pieces with the blade of a shovel.But this imposter mom was worried about the snake's health. It used a roll of paper towels to gather the snake up. \"No,\" I complained, \"it'll bite you through the towel, what are you doing?! Why?!\" But she didn't listen.

However, through the lens of hypersanity, rule-breaking emerges not as a reckless endeavor but as an essential catalyst for growth and transformation, both on a personal and societal level. This perspective asks us to rethink not just the necessity of rules but the very nature of why they exist and how they shape our experiences.\n\nThe reality is that not all rules are designed to nurture or protect. Many are relics of past circumstances, established in times that required stability or control. They may have been created by individuals who sought to maintain power or simply to preserve a tradition without questioning its present-day utility. Growth, then, requires the discernment to differentiate between those rules that foster development and those that impede progress. It calls for the courage to break those rules that have outlived their relevance and now serve as barriers rather than bridges.\n\nRule-breaking, therefore, becomes an act of liberation. It is a means of freeing ourselves from outdated paradigms that hinder progress, enabling us to step into new realities where personal and collective growth can thrive. The journey of questioning, challenging, and ultimately breaking certain rules is what allows society to evolve. This evolution is not about discarding all structures but about understanding which structures still serve us and which ones need transformation. Rule-breaking, when approached with wisdom and responsibility, is an exercise in conscious evolution\u2014an act that honors the potential for positive change.\n\n**Intelligent Rule-Breaking: Courage and Discernment**\n\nHypersanity involves a deeper insight\u2014a profound awareness that surpasses conventional definitions of sanity. In this state, one discerns which rules require breaking for growth. It is not about rebellion for rebellion's sake; it is about intentional action, driven by clarity and guided by a responsibility towards both oneself and society. Intelligent rule-breaking is thus an act of courage that comes with understanding the deeper purposes these rules serve or fail to serve.\n\nConsider\u00a0**scientific paradigms**: throughout history, some of the most groundbreaking scientific advancements have come from breaking away from established norms. Newton's laws once provided a comprehensive view of the physical world, but Einstein dared to question and expand upon them, ultimately reframing our understanding of physics. This type of rule-breaking wasn't rooted in a desire to dismantle the old, but rather to grow beyond its limitations, to find deeper truths that served humanity's evolving understanding of the universe.\n\nEinstein\u2019s work is a perfect example of how rule-breaking, when approached intelligently, leads to expansion. It required not only technical knowledge but also a deep awareness of where the existing framework fell short. Breaking away from Newtonian physics was not an act of destruction but one of creation\u2014ushering in new possibilities for how we perceive time, space, and gravity. It demonstrates that the true essence of intelligent rule-breaking lies in understanding where the old models limit us and how new models can bring a more accurate and complete understanding of reality.\n\nSimilarly,\u00a0**social norms and justice**\u00a0have seen profound shifts because individuals or movements challenged entrenched beliefs. The progress in civil rights, gender equality, and environmental protection has often come from a willingness to disregard the outdated norms that perpetuated injustice. It was not reckless rebellion but an intentional choice rooted in empathy and a vision for a more inclusive society. The courage to break these social \"rules\" is what drives meaningful transformation\u2014it paves the way for a better collective reality.\n\nMovements such as the Civil Rights Movement or the suffragette movement did not succeed simply because people were willing to break rules\u2014they succeeded because the individuals involved understood the broader implications of the norms they challenged. They recognized that these outdated rules served only to marginalize and divide. This kind of rule-breaking required a willingness to endure social disapproval, to risk personal safety, and to maintain a steadfast vision of a more just world. It required hypersanity\u2014a profound awareness that transcended the superficial sense of order, driven by a deeper understanding of what true justice and equality demanded.\n\nOn a\u00a0**personal level**, growth involves breaking the \"rules\" within ourselves\u2014rules shaped by our upbringing, past experiences, or society's influence. Many of these rules are internal boundaries that once served a protective role but now limit us. Hypersanity involves recognizing which of these rules are necessary boundaries, essential for well-being, and which are outdated beliefs that hinder personal evolution. Growth, in this sense, means dismantling those limiting beliefs with insight and replacing them with more expansive perspectives.\n\nWe are often taught rules about what is possible for us\u2014rules about our capabilities, our worth, and our potential. Many of these rules become internalized as limiting beliefs, and they restrict our ability to grow and explore new possibilities. Breaking these rules requires deep introspection, a willingness to face discomfort, and the courage to challenge our self-imposed limitations. It means seeing beyond the restrictions imposed by fear, past failures, or societal expectations, and embracing a version of ourselves that is continuously evolving. Hypersanity guides us to see that true personal growth involves not just self-improvement but the dismantling of internal constructs that keep us confined to a limited version of who we are.\n\n**The Wisdom to Break Selectively**\n\nThrough the hypersane lens, true wisdom lies in the ability to selectively break the rules that no longer serve us. It is a balanced approach that requires knowledge, foresight, and accountability. Rule-breaking, when done wisely, is not merely about the thrill of defiance; it is about transformation\u2014it is about understanding the intricate dance between what should be preserved and what must be dismantled to make way for something greater.\n\nThis selective practice demands both courage and awareness. It is a journey of acting in alignment with one's values, even when those actions defy the expectations or norms that surround us. Hypersanity provides the vision to see beyond the status quo, to understand the dynamics of power, control, and potential, and to act in ways that honor growth, connection, and truth.\n\nThe key is discernment\u2014knowing when breaking a rule will serve the greater good and when it may cause unnecessary harm. It is about acting from a place of awareness rather than ego. When we break rules in a hypersane manner, we are not motivated by the desire to prove ourselves right or superior. Instead, we are motivated by a deeper understanding of what needs to change for growth to occur. It is about bringing more authenticity, freedom, and depth to our lives and to the systems we are part of.\n\nBy cultivating the courage to break the rules that hold us back, we allow ourselves to engage in a dynamic and meaningful process of growth. This type of rule-breaking is inherently creative\u2014it involves not just rejecting old limitations but envisioning and building something better in their place. Through hypersanity, we gain the insight to know which boundaries are meant to be respected and which are meant to be transcended, leading us toward a life that is more expansive, liberated, and aligned with our highest values.\n\nUltimately, rule-breaking through the hypersane perspective is about honoring the potential for growth in all its forms. It is about trusting in our ability to discern wisely, to challenge courageously, and to evolve continuously. It reminds us that true progress\u2014whether personal, scientific, or societal\u2014depends on our willingness to question the old and dare to create the new."},{"created_date":"2025-01-31T23:02:37.000","sentiment_score":-0.8772608638,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"STRIKE 2-3-25 \u203c\ufe0fPLEASE SPREAD THE WORD IN ANY WAY YOU CAN\u203c\ufe0f\n\n#adaywithoutimmigrants"},{"created_date":"2025-01-31T20:38:55.000","sentiment_score":0.9989939332,"sentiment_label":"POSITIVE","text":"Self and community care What care work are you doing right now?

The topic of censorship, expands beyond my criticism of the left, because censirship can happen with individual people, groups,anfd just overall it can be a societal problem. \n\nI'm no stranger to censorship, and critizing online spaces. The reason why censorship is problematic is because it doesn't allow for open discussion conversation and valid criticism of particular rhetoric\/ideologies, people\/groups\/societies can be so sensitive as not to allow such criticism of their beliefs and ideologies. I've encounterred censorship many times simply for giving honest opinions, or critique of certain views, and reddit as a platform is well known for its censorship habits, it can be irritating. \n\nCensorship for me is unappealing because it sends the message that people\/groups\/societieds are closed-minded, and  lack critical thinking. Censorship severely limits growth and critical thinking, and expansion on philosopical thinking. \n\nAnyways, I feel as though the left is pretty authoritarian, it's filled with authoritarian leftist that believe that \"State Socialism\" and \"State Communism\" is possible, when In the past revolutions with Russia and the soviet union\/USSR, and China with the CCP have failed, because these system reproduced State Capitalism. Simply by referring to these countries as Socialist or Communist isn't accurate to what Socialistm and Communism is defined as. \n\nSocialism is classified as workers having free association and ownership over the means of production and the abolition of the Capitalist class and their monopolization of the means of production and workers control.\n\nCommunism is defined as a Moneyless, Stateless and Classless society, none of which the USSR and the CCP have achieved, therefore they aren't Socialist or Communist, for many authoritarian leftist they have a visceral reaction to this criticism, which led to me being banned from the Sociallist reddit forum. Which is precisely why I criticize the left, and don't consider myself a leftist because of their authoritarian views with Statism, Socialism and Communism.\n\n\nWe can never move forward and make progress if we can't have opened minded discussion or people not being to sensitive with their ideology\/rhetoric. Censorship prevents this, and it precisely how it's supposed to function by suppressing free speech and having certain biases to the more conformist or favorable ideologies\/rhetoric. \n\nI believe it's an oxymoron, to say that a country can be Socialist or Communist, and operate in a Socialist and Communist ways. Countries serve the purpose of Nationalism, Statism, Imperialism, and Colonialism.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I made this post to critque the Authoritarian left and biased censorship, so if you're not an Authoritarian leftist this post isn't for you, and if you're not a biased moderator that censores people because they have different political opinions then these criticism are definitely not for you.\n\nI made this post based on my observations of Leftist spaces, not every reddit is the same, however im particular to Revolutionary\/Radical spaces, when it comes to expressong opinions, I believe it's okay to disagree without censorship, (that's what downvotes are for).\n\nThis post may seem controversial to some and maybe taboo and that's completely fine.

Yet if you judge them by their own measure, almost all of America and Australia are Nazis for putting up with the concentration camps that are already established."},{"created_date":"2025-01-30T02:10:03.000","sentiment_score":0.8839164972,"sentiment_label":"POSITIVE","text":"Trump To Build Mass Concentration Camp For Deportees At Guant\u00e1namo Bay "},{"created_date":"2025-01-29T20:10:16.000","sentiment_score":-0.982141614,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"The Candle of Despair: A Warning to the Working Class \u201cIf man is infinitely malleable\u2014without innate mental structures or needs\u2014he becomes the perfect subject for control by the state, the entrepreneur, the technocrat.\u201d\n\nWe stand at a crossroads in history.

I've been paralyzed, because I've seen no path for me, other than as a naysayer, a complainer, a whiner, a critic.\n\nI've read a bit, and done some thinking on my own, and I've basically arrived at the conclusion that human beings are essentially organized into hierarchies and systems that are extremely messed up, with state power (at the national level) being the common enemy hanging over all our heads (as I think anyone on this sub might agree). \n\nI don't believe it's possible to attack the nation-states from the top-down and be \"stateless\" at any point in my my life.

However I see flaws in Revolutionary and Radical thought here. \n\nMost revolutionaries still have this ideal of a revolution being about Anarchist, Anticapitalist, Antiauthoritarians, overthrowing the system of State and Capitalism overnight through vanguard militarized action. When this is not only a power fantasy but it wouldn't be useful or effective on actually changing our material reality. It would only reproduced a Capitalist and Statist system.\n\nA revolution is a series of uprisings, resistances and revolts against current political system that exist which don't work or serve in favor of the masses. While we can't plan an Anarchist society, because it would be a finality, a revolution does take strong horizontal power structures and planning  and proper self-defense against Fascism and Statism. \n\nI feel as though it's easy to talk about revolution online and discuss theory, but it's takes more energy and effort to put in the praxis. For many people whether you're a radical or not, we often love the idea of community but lack motivation, energy or time commitment to craft the society we want to build, mostly due to a hyper individuallist society we already live under, we tend to pay attention more to our personal issues, which is valid. And revolutionary action isn't going to look the same for everyone, internationally we all deal with different varying degrees of oppression that need different solutions. When it comes to praxis there isn't a formula that fits everyone.\n\n\nIt's easy to be lazy in thinking and praxis about revolution especially for those that are already dealing with hyper individuallism and isolation. Which is my case as well. It's especially more of a challenge when there's a task of educating people on Anarchist views, the bedrock of revolution is people recognizeing their dialectic material conditions, learning about the oppressive institutions they must eradicate, and educating other people in the processes, forming mutal networks etc. However class consciousness, comes from societies having to experience the destructive natures of a system.\n\nIn the case of the American Empire it is in major decline and has been for decades, economic crisis, environmental crisis with climate change and illnesses, inflation, etc. it's an Empire that's in denial, and it's the working class that will suffer from the decline, not the Demagogues or the Capitalist. The problem is that many people still buy into the Electoral system every four years hoping for change because that's much easier than the effort of direct action for some. \n\nAnyway a bit of a rant, but I just find it weird and irritating how many people still have this belief that a revolution will happen overnight through militarized vanguard action when it's more complicated than that, and revolutionnary action isn't the same for all of us across the globe. I also find it extremely weird how some people believe the State will \"help\" in the  Anticapitalist and Antistatist revolution. History has shown that when there's any opposition that is a threat to the State that it will eliminate its opposition through force and coercion.

A lie that we\u2019re free, that this system works for us, that if we just work hard enough, we\u2019ll achieve the dream. But look closer\u2014the dream is a mirage, designed to keep us chasing while they reap the rewards. The few, those at the top, have declared themselves gods, ruling over us as though they own not just the wealth but the very air we breathe.\n\nThe truth is harsh, but it must be said: we are nothing more than cogs in their machine, spinning endlessly to make the rich richer, the powerful more powerful. But if we can\u2019t live free, the system can\u2019t stand.\n\nWe\u2019ve been told that scarcity is the reason for our struggle. That there aren\u2019t enough resources, so we must compete, fight, and claw for scraps. But that\u2019s another lie. Think about this: there are over 333 million people in America alone\u2014and the reality is, we have the resources to stop the constant churn of mass production, to live sustainably, and still thrive. There\u2019s enough land, food, energy, and technology to create a society that ensures every single person\u2019s survival and dignity.\n\nSo why don\u2019t we? Because this system thrives on greed. Corporations would rather let food rot in warehouses than give it to the hungry. They\u2019d rather pollute rivers and destroy forests than lose a dollar of profit. They\u2019d rather exploit our personal data, manipulate us with marketing, and push endless consumerism than admit the truth: this isn\u2019t about meeting our needs; it\u2019s about feeding their power.\n\nThey sell us the illusion of choice while using psychological manipulation to control our desires. They\u2019ve turned our lives into commodities, our data into currency, and our labor into fuel for their machine. The system wasn\u2019t built to serve us\u2014it was built to enslave us. But our unity, their downfall.\n\nHistory shows us the truth. From the Gilded Age of robber barons to the billionaires of today, the system has always been rigged. Corporations crush workers to cut costs. Politicians sell their souls to the highest bidder. Wars are waged to protect profits, not people. Many voices, one movement is their greatest fear.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014they only win if we stay divided. They\u2019ve spent decades pitting us against each other. Left vs. right. Rural vs. urban. Black vs. white. It\u2019s a strategy straight out of Orwell\u2019s 1984. They want us too distracted fighting one another to see the real enemy. Because they know the truth: we are more than cogs in their machine; we are the revolution.\n\nThink about the power we hold. Together, we outnumber them a thousand to one. Together, we are unstoppable. They control the wealth, the media, and the laws, but none of that matters if we refuse to comply. If we unite, resist, and rebuild, we can create a system that works for all of us, not just the privileged few. The time is now: unite, resist, rebuild.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about tearing down their machine. It\u2019s about building something better. A future where no one is exploited for a paycheck, where no child goes hungry, where no voice is silenced because it challenges the status quo. It\u2019s about reclaiming the dream they\u2019ve stolen from us. Rise as one, reclaim the future.\n\nWe are done begging for scraps from their table.

If you don\u2019t feel like reading a redditor\u2019s summarized ideological life story feel free to move on to another post. But thank you if you decide to stay. \n\nI am very happy to call myself an anarchist after several years of floating in the political limbo of not adhering strictly to an ideology. I grew up protestant in the US and from there I naturally became a good ol\u2019 american neoliberal, as I would have called myself a christian conservative when i was an older teenager. That didn\u2019t last too long as I only adhered to that ideology from growing up in that environment, but deep down I knew that wasn\u2019t really who I am even if i didn\u2019t realize that at first. \n\nA few existential crises later I was floating around in an ideological void after leaving american christianity behind, hanging out with my two new best friends who happen to be a tankie and an anarchist. How they are such close friends being so ideologically opposed in many ways is another interesting story entirely on its own. I began to realize i\u2019ve always had a pretty left leaning personality and values, but now i\u2019d fully get the chance to express them in their totality. But I had a choice to make. I was surrounded by auth communism along with anarchism at the same time, and I couldn\u2019t choose. I had convinced myself that \u201canarchy wouldn\u2019t work\u201d and that the auth commies had to be right. \u201cWho would run air traffic control in an anarchist commune?\u201d I thought. So I called myself a Marxist for a little while. It didn\u2019t stick. I kinda hated it actually. My body rebelled against the label. \n\nAnother year or so went by. And the answer ended up being a lot more simple than I ever would have thought: What do I want to live out as my own life and help welcome the world into? And that answer is anarchism. I don\u2019t like state power structures. I don\u2019t like vertical hierarchy. I hate oppression. There\u2019s hardly a worse feeling than the weight of authority upon one\u2019s being. I want every human being to have no one above them, no one below them. None be forced to bear the weight of nations. None be beaten down by the force of the state. \n\nOther answers followed from there. What\u2019s stopping us from running air traffic control? We don\u2019t have to have a hierarchy to do it. All it takes is action and coordination.\n\nA lot of ideas I had for a very long time have begun to click one after the other. Even when I was immersed in american protestantism I always disliked the power structures in church and school and wondered why we couldn\u2019t do things differently and actually be fair to each other and help each other. Like how some kids went without lunch cause they couldn\u2019t pay for it. I\u2019ve always thought money to be such a stupid concept. \n\nSo anarchism for me was a bit inevitable really. Wanting to dismantle hierarchy has always been in me. I hope I can find a place here on this subreddit and others like this one. If you\u2019ll have me, as a young anarchist, let\u2019s dismantle the structured world.

However, I didn't mention the crucial point of this unrest: the election fraud conspiracy theory, the result of right-wing populism and authoritarianism in our society.

Korea is North Korea, and beyond it are China and Russia, two anti-West fascist \\(Dengist\\\/Putinist\\) regimes](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1yh4b97bb5fe1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e6486d246e255a81cf08d6c4758cd55e3542ae9)\n\nAs you know, South Korea has been always pro-West, while North Korea, along with China and USSR-&gt;Russia, have been mostly anti-West. Due to such reasons, the term \ubd81\uc911\ub7ec(NK-CN-RU) has been often used, and Korean right-wing, often seeing them as \"communist or ex-communist dictatorship regimes\", became extremely pro-West and Japanophile.\n\nTherefore, when HK protesters, who were British (pro-West) 23 years ago, lost to China, a \"communist\" (I mean state capitalist) anti-West country, South Koreans were extremely shocked, since it might be Korea's next future.\n\n[\\\\\"Jews are genetically inferior, but they are controlling all banks and corporations\\\\\" - Nazis](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vx6dilokc5fe1.png?width=1532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3d696da8d8ef415b3354306b03728513c44e6fe)\n\nThese anti-communist and anti-anti-West sentiments, combined with anti-Chinese racism (including anti-Korean-Chinese racism, since Korean Chinese are often seen as \"brainwashed Chinese who are no longer Korean\"), turned into the significant conspiracy theory.\n\n2. \"China Gate\"\n\n[The first of all](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9hidhigwe5fe1.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adee6f7170193560e17447f2454d1cb1785ec54f)\n\nIn 2020, when [the legislative election](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2020_South_Korean_legislative_election) was coming soon, a right-wing user, who insisted that he is a Korean Chinese, said that liberals are Chinese proxies and pro-liberal, pro-Chinese\/pro-NK, anti-Japanese\/anti-USA, and anti-conservative replies and tweets are written by Chinese agents. \n\nAccording to this writing, many internet users discovered the \"suspicious activities\", and believed that pro-liberal opinions on Internet are dominated by Chinese agents, and that the election will prove it.\n\nHowever, the result was: liberals taking more than 180 seats out of 300, while conservatives barely covering about 105 seats.\n\n3.

I hope it's okay to ask this here -- this seems to be one of the only subs with discussions about broad community involvement, unless I overlooked something. \n\nThe election cycle has whipped up a lot of fear and anxiety, as usual, and in response there are a lot of calls to get organized and become involved within your community, as usual. I don't mean to sound dismissive or jaded, it's just that at nearly 30 this isn't my first rodeo, but I am feeling very small and very ineffective this time around. \n\nI live in the deep south, one of those \"blue dots in a sea of red\" type cities. It likes to project itself as progressively-minded, but it's just very status-quo liberal. Still I was able to connect with some more radical folks out here (there aren't many!) and it felt like there was hope for forging community and strong connections and doing good work. \n\nBut I ended up having really terrible experiences with local community organizing efforts. The most upsetting was with an anarchist group that I worked with for about a year, which ultimately kicked me out of the organizing space for being lgbtq and neurodivergent -- in their words, it made things 'awkward' and made other people 'uncomfortable'. Then proceeded to steal from me and threaten violence against me. \n\nI moved on to other projects and groups but they all fell apart. One project that really felt like it was going to make a difference ended up selling out for corporate funding and threw its principles under the bus. Other groups and organizations lost steam and membership as folks moved away or lost interest, and eventually folded their chapters. And others, that ableist\/transphobic anarchist group ended up taking over. \n\nFor awhile some of us tried to start our own community group &amp; independent projects. But the oft-given advice, \"Just organize the community\/set up mutual aid networks\/do the projects yourself!\" is so much harder than it sounds in practice. We realized we didn't have a lot of experience under our belts but \"organizing veterans\" we appealed to for guidance were burnt out and wanted nothing to do with any more of it. So we just gave it our best try, and I know the idea is that if you set an example folks will see and become involved, but that isn't what happened. Definitionally, this isn't work that can be done by yourself or with just 2 or 3 people. The logistics aren't possible. We didn't do a damn bit of good, but we sure exhausted ourselves spinning our tires in the mud. \n\nGet involved. Get organized. Make a difference. Don't look away. Don't choose inaction.

Can accept goverment advertising but without being the main income.\n\n3.- Journalists inside can be working full-time, part-time or freelancing.

Paying them well for that (Video, Photo and Writers).\n\n7.- Once per year (minimun) they show their incomes and also salaries of the workers (but not the names for privacy). They dont especulate with their money.\n\n8.- Not using  \u201cclickbait\u201d titles and subtitles. \n\nA desirable:\n\n1.- Using free software or at least MIT license for their webpage or blog. \n2.- Not using fascists social networks like Meta, X, Google.\n3.- Not selling information of the suscribers to any third party business.\n4.- Using Creative Commons licenses.\n\nI know that is difficult right now to have all the criterias ticked but let\u00b4s mark the most \u201cfree media\u201d collaborating in this subreddit.

Lopez  and his lawyers didn't find out until 2020 that it was neither the traffic offenses nor the dog that led to Lopez's downfall: It was location data from his phone, which revealed he was passing through the border at a place where there was no monitored crossing. \n   \n  A secret underground tunnel led from Mexico to a property he owned in the Arizona border town of San Luis.\nA handful of small-town border cops hadn't been actively monitoring Lopez's phone location. They were purchasing the information from third-party brokers, who were collecting GPS data produced by the apps on Lopez's phone.\n\n Byron Tau, then a Wall Street Journal reporter, reported that year that the federal government, particularly immigration officials, had begun purchasing such data, which had typically been meant for use by advertising companies. \n  \n(It was Tau who told Lopez's lawyers about the data purchases, in the course of reporting his story.)\n \n   In this way, both local and federal police were bypassing Fourth Amendment restrictions to get information that would typically require probable cause and a warrant.\n\n\n"},{"created_date":"2025-01-22T21:24:21.000","sentiment_score":0.9998362064,"sentiment_label":"POSITIVE","text":"AN INCREDIBLE DOCUMENTARY NY AN AUTONOMUS REPORTER ABOUTTHE WAR IN SYRIA!

As a classic white-collar worker for the past 3+ years (working in the digital marketing industry), I've developed a huge theoretical interest in the techniques of compliance, manipulation, and control in the workplace under neoliberal capitalism. Techniques that, unfortunately, many employees fall for without even recognizing them as attempts of manipulation and compliance.\n\nBelow, I\u2019m sharing a list of such techniques and I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts:\n\n- Meetings (especially daily or very frequent ones): Corporate meetings are always hierarchical; you're \"assigned\" to speak by someone else (or you never speak at all as an employee). They serve as a method of enforcing compliance with corporate \"processes\" and are also a means of reinforcing hierarchies and controlling your workload and daily tasks (they're afraid of time theft).\n\n- Lunch and Learn: In some companies, free meals are offered with the condition that employees attend corporate brainwashing sessions during their break about \"how awesome we are as a company.\"\n\n- \"The company as a family\": The tired old clich\u00e9 that \"we are a family here\" attempts an emotional blackmail strategy, aiming to make employees \"feel obligated\" to go the extra mile for their \"family\" (e.g., unpaid overtime).\n\n- Employee surveillance tools: A classic and extremely invasive control practice under the guise of \"enhancing productivity.\"\n\n- Pizza Fridays, after-work drinks, and other social bonding events: These so-called \"job perks\" that many consider \"cool\" are actually distractions from meaningful raises, improved working conditions, etc. They also serve as a compliance and submission tool to the company\u2019s doctrine (e.g., if an employee repeatedly skips such events, they are demonized, ridiculed, and ostracized).\n\n- Managers and HR: Managers are not part of the working class; they belong to a different class (PMC - Professional Managerial Class). They monitor you, assign tasks, reprimand, fire you, etc. Essentially, they are the bosses' watchdogs within the workplace. HR exists solely to protect the company's interests\u2014they don\u2019t care about employees at all.\n\nApologies for my lousy English, but I would really love to discover more of these techniques so I can recognize them better from now on. Feel free to share your insights, suggest relevant books\/articles, etc.\n\nThanks for your time!"},{"created_date":"2025-01-22T09:55:15.000","sentiment_score":-0.9618948698,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"[South Korea] Supporters of President Yoon break into Seoul Western District Court...

hello everyone :)\n\ni hope this does fit the guidelines here and stays on topic. i wanted to ask here, due to the values and interests we share. i figured this would be one of the better spaces to ask, then.\n\ni am a student, and feel like pressure is put on me (especially by my mother) in order for me to get a \"good diploma\" and follow higher studies. an engineering degree, for example. the reason for this is something along the lines of this idea :\n\n\"Think of it this way: suffer through the schooling for a little bit, to set yourself up for the rest of your life\", as a wonderful friend of mine put it. so, likely something along the lines of \"well-paying jobs\" and job security.\n\nbut this seems to be a very strange idea to me. i find that from when i was born to today, where i will soon be back on studies, i just spend so much time.. learning, studying, yet nothing to get a job NOW and be done with it all. or no support from my environment to do exactly that. i feel like most people try and convince me to stick to those studies, but i am genuinely confused as to why i couldn't just.. not follow higher studies, at least for now, and do something with my life.\n\nthe things i could actually do right now to help give to the community are majoritarily, if not all things i learned on my own or outside of school : using my proficiency in english as a french native for translation work, cooking which could be used to help communities, knowledge of software\/IT which i could use to help communities and specific people with technology, such as the elderly... i could find more examples if i took more time, but i hope this gets the point across well.\n\nsince the start of those higher studies, i also questionned myself on some things. mainly :\n\n- do we really need to follow higher studies (or at least, the \"bigger\" ones such as engineering) to have good stable jobs? as a young leftist\/anarchist, i'm really doubting of the idea that we have to suffer through the schooling to set oneself up for life. \n\n- what would those studies bring to us, both as individuals and for our communities ? so many people talk about doing higher studies, but i just struggle to find why we'd have to follow those to help people build a better world. is it just because of capitalism and the like?\n\ni'm so confused by this idea. i imagine i can do things such as urban planning, but this only really works when governments want to use urban planning for a more social\/ecological environment.. so why focus on this as a guarantee? if we can help our communities and people in similar ways without relying on those higher studies, is following those studies really so important?\n\nsorry if this is all a confused, jumbled mess of words. as an anarchist and young adult, it's very hard to make a place for yourself in this world. i've tried to think about those issues for about a year and a half now but still do not get anywhere. i'm really lost and i don't know if anyone would have anything to say on the matter... i also hope this post is not interpreted as anti-intellectualism. i'm not against the idea of higher studies at all, moreso what those studies realistically lead you to do in the current world along the fact that we already have much of the knowledge we need to move forward and probably don't need to find\/invent more things.\n\ni hope all is well for you, and have a great day :)\n\n# much needed TL;DR\n\ni feel i am pressured into following studies, more specifically engineering studies as they \"ensure a better job security and salary\". this idea makes me feel alienated because i struggle to understand the point of studies *in a capitalist world* given everything we can already do to help communities without those higher studies. most of what could be done to help communities thanks to studies of most\/any kind, such as philosophy, seem to have to depend on either governments (which seem increasingly far-right) or capitalist corporations, which would go against the interests of people at large. i'm aware that it's Slightly Hard to live a life distanced from capitalism, but if one wants to be as close to this life, i'm not sure of if following long studies would change this pratically. i'm also not very convinced of the idea that one has to do such studies to live a fulfilling life. you give meaning to yourself, studies don't give this meaning to you. i'm also pretty sure you can make job security work with such goals, and that if you live frugally the lower salaries won't be much of a problem."},{"created_date":"2025-01-21T10:25:53.000","sentiment_score":-0.9634177089,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"It seems like Elon Musk is merely following his legacy.

Here is a quote from the essay describing the concept, \"the primal father\u2014the ultimate and original patriarch\u2014has absolute power over his sons and demands from them devotion and obedience. The sons fear the primal father equally, thus creating a bond and sense of equality and community between them.\"\n\nHere is how I'm viewing the situation: For anarchists, the primal father is the State. But I think that's only the most obvious answer and perhaps others have more interesting interpretations. \n\nThe quote above is followed by this, \"However, as the father\u2014the archetypal absolute sovereign\u2014enjoys unrestricted access to all the women of tribe, prohibiting it to the sons, the sons band together to kill and devour the father. Yet, so the myth goes, this ultimate transgression creates a sense of collective guilt amongst the sons, and thus the law against incest arises. I will return to this later, as it has important consequences for this discussion: ***the removal of one form of prohibition does not necessarily free us as internalized constraints come to the fore to take its place.***\"\n\nDoes that change your answer? It's made me think twice about mine, but I can't come up with another off the top of my head. \n\n"},{"created_date":"2025-01-20T00:15:33.000","sentiment_score":-0.9981867671,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"It's Time for Mod Elections Again | Jan 20 - Jan 27 Probably past time, but it's mostly just me here now, and January is tough so tbh I forgot.

When I see the term Neo-Luddite online, I often see people like Ted Kaczynski brought up. Technophobes, rather than the Techno-Skepticist that make up the majority of the decentralized movement, just like how the original Luddites were painted as anti-technology when they were really just opposed to the centralization of industry and its place over their lives. I just want to state that I am not against tech. I love technology, I love computers, I love the internet, I love video games. As a millennial, these were my childhood. If you knew me irl, you might think I was a Retro-Tech fetishist. Someone who is obsessed with Web 1.0 and the aesthetics of the 2000s. While that is true, I have my reasons:\n\nThe current state of technology is that of classism, militarism, surveillance and exploitation of resources, labor and the environment. I am not fine with tech being used in such ways, and that as Anarchists we must stand by our morals and search for a way to undermine it. Here are a few things I propose for other Techno-Skeptics\/Neo-Luddites:\n\n* Minimalist Tech: Buy an MP3 player or a higher end DAP if you need it, learn how to torrent and or just rip the tracks off of your own CDs. Prioritize dumb devices that have specific usages over smart devices fhat have connections to the internet. Smartphone is your worst enemy, it is a distraction, a surveillance camera and a tool of psychological manipulation. I would suggest buying burners or flip phones over high end products like Iphone or Galaxy too. Buy a handheld console that boots roms. Stuff like that. Dont use streaming services, don't pay unless you are paying to support the development of the media, or to own the data forever.\n* Digital Minimalism: (This somewhat ties into the Minimalist tech but I thought I would make its own section) Limit the time you spend on devices. This doesn't exactly mean spend less time on digital devices, especially if thats your job or outlet for activism, you might want to, but to use them with intent. Limit your devices that are connected to the internet, have a singular device that is for using the internet. The internet is an extremely powerful tool for activism, spreading awareness, sharing media and opinions, but it can be a double edged sword when going in blind, and or if you are vulnerable to their manipulation, such as if you are a gambling addict, shopping addict, etc. Breaking yourself from that connection that these corporations have over your attention is key.\n* Software Minimalism and Modular Design: These are core tenets of the Unix Philosophy. Supporting, using or creating simple, efficient and accessible software. A focus in smaller file sizes, less resource intensiveness and ease of use is a way to democratize data and to make it more widely available to the general public. The smaller the file, the less incentive you have to delete it. The easier the code, the easier it is to modify, to innovate and to learn from. The more widely utilizable it will be. For example, take video games. People in both First and Third World countries can play games like Minecraft together more easily they can play Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 together, and it will have more longevity and improvements as a result of its ability to be customized and played in almost any device.\n* Embrace and host Third Spaces on the Internet: There needs to be places away from Capitalist interest online. There is a big attack on our freedom of speech with the Tik Tok ban, on apps like Twitter, as well as Facebook. Hell, Reddit is most likely a psyop. Whilst these can be good tools for outreach in specific instances, they should not be your primary method of interacting with the internet or communication as they are multibillion dollar companies, companies who do not have your best interest at heart, as they have proven time and time again. They steal your data, they manipulate your perception, they utilize algorithms to control the stream of information. Not good. I would suggest sites like SPACEHEY (a Myspace clone that allows you to customize your profile with html graphics, music players, etc. It only takes donations and sells merch. Thats it. Free to use.) MASTADON (A decentralized Twitter clone that hosts multiple smaller servers rather than just one) DISCORD (A server hosting site where you can set up your own servers that have chat channels, voice channels, you can stream, etc) TELEGRAM (A free encrypted messsging app that allows you to create group channels and share up to 1gb filesize. Great for hosting books, information or just talking) or SUBSTACK (a site that allows to write and share articles). Or hell, make your own site. I'll be the first person on your message board.\n\nAnyways, Ill end it here for sake of my thumbs. I am really passionate about this topic and I thank you for reading all the way through. I hope you all enjoy your day!

He lived near the same time as the Russian Revolution and much of his writing makes reference to it. He liked Kropotkin in particular\n\nI initially wrote off Alexander Atabekian for some reason. I think it's because I started with his essay on \"territoriality,\" which was not the best place to start, and doesn't seem reflective of his larger body of work. If he had any larger works, they're not on the anarchist library, but what is there is succinct and echoes other \"classicals\" with a lucidity that I wasn't expecting\n\nI've never heard Atabekian's name come up in any anarchist discussion. I guess it would make sense if he didn't write that much, but I've heard Reclus name. He didn't write much either I don't think, besides the geography. So here is some stuff Atabekian wrote, which I liked. I will link each piece to each piece. They're all very short\n\nMore than once Atabekian uses \"power\" and \"authority\" interchangeably, as I think someone like Louise Michel does. He will also occasionally make reference to \"moral authority\". I believe this is a figure of speech however, maybe similar in his diction to \"confidence\". He will just as or more often repudiate authority in its entirety, and lays out clearly, with direct reference to right, a conceptualization of the latter that seems to easily fall within the authority held in contempt by other anarchists\n\n&gt; What characterises anarchism, what is common to all anarchists, whatever their starting point and way of thinking, is the rejection of authority, the denial of the right of people to forcibly subjugate other people, even if the power comes from a numerical majority. Diderot formulated this thought in the following words: \u201cNature has created neither masters nor servants; I want neither to make nor to receive laws\u201d.\n\n-[The Old and New in Anarchism](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-the-old-and-new-in-anarchism)\n\n\nTangentially, he has a second and uncompromising repudiation of democracy, up to and including \"direct legislation\".\n\n&gt; By its other basic property, the free association of individuals, with the right of each of them to withdraw from the association at any time, co-operation excludes coercion. Being free and voluntary in its internal construction, co-operation is hostile to external violence, which is an inevitable property of state power. Politically, co-operation can be neither monarchical, nor republican, nor democratic (as V. Kilchevsky claims), nor Soviet, since coercion is inherent in all power. Even under the most ideal state system, under direct popular legislation of property equal people, the majority subordinates the minority to its will. \n\n-[Co-operation and Anarchism](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-co-operation-and-anarchism)\n\nHe talked about Bolshevism a lot. He didn't like it. His critique of \"class struggle\" particularly as it was understood and exercised by the Bolsheviks I found resonant\n\n&gt; Thus capital, from the largest to the smallest amounts, are closely woven into the process of production, exchange and distribution of products. The class of capitalists is diffused throughout society and it is not possible to single it out into a separate class.\n\n&gt; Class struggle is the frozen dogma of the faith of all socialists and even of many anarchists. The terrible consequences of the widespread dissemination and application of this scientifically untenable theory in the ignorant masses of the Russian people, we have seen and experienced since the February Revolution, especially after the triumph of the direct heirs of the International \u2014 the Social-Democrats (Bolsheviks), in close contact (for the first time in history) with their co- heirs \u2014 the anarchists.\n\n&gt; After the October coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, which became so bloody thanks to the exaltation instilled by this theory, the \u201cbourgeois\u201d began to be searched for. But the search was in vain. The crimes of capitalism were in plain sight, but the criminal himself was elusive. It turned out that the bourgeoisie, as a class of people, had been absorbed into the middle, and even partly into the lower strata of the population. It was possible to point to some individual rich people, but even those have long since disappeared\u2026 They continued to look for the bourgeoisie, and in Moscow they found it in the person of Osip Minor, who had grown old because of his struggle for socialism in prisons and penal servitude, and his comrades in the party, in the person of the revolutionary officers and that part of the student youth which had rallied round the party of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, while the other part had joined the Bolsheviks. And nightmarish events took place, fraternal blood was shed on both sides in glorification of the new dogma of the faith of the ignorant people \u2014 the class struggle. This dogma awakened the spirit of fanaticism dormant in every ignorant man. And the darkest times of religious persecution were resurrected..\u2026\n\n-[The Old and New in Anarchism](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-the-old-and-new-in-anarchism)\n\nA very Kropotkin-y line here, I believe part of this might be a direct quote \n\n&gt; anarchy is above all the freedom of the individual, bounded only by the equal freedom of another individual, whoever he may be by conviction; it is natural morality without sanction or compulsion.\n\n-[Questions of Theory and Practice](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-questions-of-theory-and-practice)\n\n\nAnti-coercion is a big part of his project, which I agree with less, but I do find parts of it enchanting\n\n&gt; The anarchist who raises his hand to search another person, even if only for weapons, is no longer a proud ideological anarchist; he is lower than the last policeman; at least he does not hide behind the banner of freedom. The anarchist who crosses the threshold of another\u2019s dwelling to search it, even if only again for weapons, is a criminal against the high and pure doctrine which our ideological opponents consider unattainable.\n\n-[Questions of Theory and Practice](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-questions-of-theory-and-practice)\n\nSo provided Atabekian's uncompromising anti-authority anarchy, I see a complication of anarchism's ideological commitments that seems like it echoes through other places. It is the ground floor for his anarchism, opposing authority as a path to liberty and things of that nature\n\nThere are more pieces, some on organization. His talk here is similarly eloquent. He talks much about approaching anarchy as science, and speaks of trouble with anarchist \"congresses\" that couldn't bind their members, and otherwise became fraught with disintegration and new authorities. Insofar as anarchy is science, for Alexander Atabekian, this is no problem, because a conference is not where those decisions are made; organization is concerned principally with what is possible - external constraints, rather than consensus, the decision-making of majorities, etc.., and I think too a thread of individual works coalescing into collective action\n\n&gt; Just as the scientific congresses contributed little to science, because no binding resolutions were possible and science develops and grows through painstaking laboratory and office work, so too the anarchist congresses gave the comrades who came together an opportunity for personal communication and exchange of opinions, but that was all; they played no organisational role. The modern anarchist movement has grown and consolidated in its original groups.\n\n-[Questions of Theory and Practice](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-questions-of-theory-and-practice)\n\n&gt; We are not talking about other inconveniences of the central organization. Let\u2019s just say that a large part of the Armenian revolutionaries experienced the destructive and harmful influence of that \u201ccenter\u201d on their skin and was forced to withdraw from that idea. If until now those \u201ccenters\u201d have not finally destroyed the cause, the reason is that the cause itself is an essential, organic demand for the people and continues outside the centers, independently of them and often against all of them.\n\n&gt; \u201cSo, in your opinion,\u201d they answer us, \u201cthe general organization of the revolutionary force is impossible?\u201d Not at all. The only thing that follows from what we have said is that we need to look for other means and forms of organization \u2014 that we should not work in vain efforts and in vain time to form a unity of Yanun activity, but we must work with all our strength for the Yanun revolution, from which itself gave birth to a union and a permanent organization.\n\n&gt; ...activity, life develops a common plan of action for Armenian revolutionaries, then the place of current theoretical disputes will be replaced by a practical solidarity among various perfectly independent groups, none of which will try to impose either its principles or its tactics on the heads of others, and only then will we have a true organization \u2014 an organization that will arise from vital conditions, from the efforts made \u2014 an organization that will be based on the direct and close relations of the working groups.\n\n-[Revolutionary Organization](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-revolutionary-organization)\n\nSome of his writing was on World War I. In \"The Problem of a Free Army,\" he says that he worked as a doctor for two years in the Russian Army. His description of the way wartime economics undermined capitalism is very interesting, I don't know if it's more wholly his or if he derives this from somewhere \n\n&gt; The world war destroyed the foundations of the capitalist economy, while the October revolution continues its work and destroys the very forms of the capitalist system.\n\n&gt; War, that factor of discord, oppression and destruction, this time became fruitful and constructive. This was because, in its unprecedented size and duration, it shook up the entire economic life of the globe. It became a literal war of nations and subjugated all strata of society to its equalizing demands.\n\n&gt; It has barely disguised the extensive expropriations of private property by the name of requisitions; it has destroyed free trade by fixing prices; it has sought to equalise all strata of the\npopulation by food organisations for the equal distribution of essential foodstuffs. In short, the foundations of the capitalist system have been struck blow by blow, and this not only in our own country, but to an even greater extent in central and western Europe. The stronghold of class divisions, governmental power, has so far survived, but even in it large holes have been punctured.\n\n&gt; This unification of all strata of society in Western Europe has already begun to bear fruit, it is rebuilding the social order on new principles more methodically and firmly than we have in Russia; this reorganisation of the social order of the West is pointed out by Kropotkin in his \u201cLetters on Current Events\u201d, and only due to poor knowledge, due to the conditions of wartime, we can not take a closer look at this creative side of life in Europe, caused by the current war. In Russia, this association emerged and blossomed in the direction of social construction in the early years of the war. It found a wide field of practical application, rich material and useful experience in the activities of the All-Russian Zemsky Union and other public organisations. The business of organising aid to millions of refugees \u2014 to whole nations \u2014 became a school of practical socialism. Then the activity of public organisations spread to the greatest part of the population. It was their fruitful activity that created our food organisations and developed the initial technique of supplying and distributing foodstuffs.\n\n-The Old and New\n\nI thought his accusation specifically of the way authoritarian organization undermined the Russian army's capacity to fight was interesting too. Reminiscent of Bakunin, who theorized that authority is caustic to expertise (which Alexander Atabekian proposes that he witnessed in practice). I do not know if this is grounded in good history, but his perspective is neat\n\n&gt; After the February Revolution, which was to change the whole way of social life in the whole country, it was clear to everyone that the army could not retain its old forms. It, too, had to be renewed. What did the scientifically educated officers, as a professional category, do to point out to the broad layers of the people and the soldiering masses the right ways for renewal? Exactly nothing. We had officers with solid scientific knowledge and combat experience, but we had no officers. There was no purely professional spirit of association among our officers, standing beyond and above political and social beliefs and views. The army was led not by united professional workers, but by disparate officials appointed at the discretion of their superiors from above. This is what ruined the army in the first place.\n\n&gt; The truth is that we did not have a purely professional association of officers on the basis of technical knowledge, which would have enjoyed moral authority and would have been able to take into its own hands the work of army renewal from the very beginning. Our officers in the general mass, without initiative, without social outlook, with their thinking squeezed into the deadening framework of routine, were not capable of taking the lead in the reorganisation of the army on new principles, and by habit became inert, waiting for orders from above or clinging to the decaying old forms. From above came the political agitators, driven by the phantoms of the old power. From above came demagogues, chasing themselves after the power that intoxicates man. The results \u2014 we have read them in the Brest peace treaty and are reading them in Mirbach\u2019s notes.\n\n&gt; From this point of view, any anarchist-revolutionary \u2014 for defensive war is essentially an organised revolution against external state oppressors \u2014 can only welcome the initiative of \u201cMilitary Affairs\u201d. It is high time to make military affairs purely professional, to transfer them to the healthy ground of \u201cknowledge and skill\u201d instead of \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d and \u201cI obey!\u201d before the state power.\n\n&gt; Authority can call any accumulation of people an \u201carmy,\u201d such as the \u201cRed Army,\u201d but it cannot make it an army.\n\n-[The Problem of a Free Army](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-the-problem-of-a-free-army)\n\nWith regards to \"Territoriality and Anarchism\" I have mixed feelings, because I think there is an interesting point at the center of the work (given a certain tendency to view humans and environments and \"organistic\" to each other, although I do not know if that's a misapplication of Proudhon's unity-collectivity). \n\n&gt; If we look closely at the life of individual animal families and their societies, we will notice that each of them uses a certain place of residence \u2014 nest, burrow, den, anthill, beehive \u2014 and a relatively limited space of land, i.e. the territory on which it harvests the means for its own existence and for the preservation of the species (offspring). Even migratory birds, and those at different times of the year, return to their former home and old nest. The same is observed in nomadic tribes, which do not wander around the world wherever they see fit, but have their own definite kyshlagi and eylagi (as nomadic Tatars call the places of their winter and summer stay).\n\n&gt; The connection with the homeland is so strong in man that even with the modern extraordinary development of communication routes, people are very reluctant to move from their homeland, and then only under the pressure of irresistible economic necessity.\n\n&gt; Anarchism has so far put forward the territorial homeland \u2014 the commune \u2014 as its closest political ideal, because it was easier to imagine and realise a just social order there. But doom inevitably awaits the commune in a surrounding, hostile environment, as happened to Paris in 1871. In order to establish itself, anarchism must develop forms of organisation of large defensible units and then unite other countries more and more closely with its cultural influence. This is the direction in which the revival of the Anarchist International must be sought.\n\n-[Territoriality and Anarchism](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-territoriality-and-anarchism)\n\nI'm unsure about his usage of \"commune\" as a territorial homeland, however now with the additional context of his other work I'm also not sure if he's using this in any particular national sense. I don't think he is. It almost seems like the essay is less about territoriality and more concerned with addressing the divide created by WW1 between \"anti-militarist\" anarchists and anarchists who supported the Entente. His point basically seems to be that neither option makes sense and that when an *anarchist* \"homeland\" is created (a \"homeland\" within his concept being any locality where they live and are organized towards) there's a coherent basis for attacking -archic forces that want to assimilate it. This seems like an unobjectionable position\n\nThere's some other things of his I haven't read, and I will now. I feel comfortable keeping his work in my back pocket as a \"starting point\" for most people, as much of this seems pure anarchism and not strictly anarcho-communism. His collection of ideas seems like ittouches a lot of important bases and does it in an easily readable way\n\nTwo last quotes that seem to wrap it up\n\n&gt; Theoretical anarchism is a science; its practice must become an applied science.\n\n&gt; You have to act to organize. Action, constant action \u2014 this is the only way to organization."},{"created_date":"2025-01-19T04:42:24.000","sentiment_score":-0.9987309575,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Does anybody know where I can get a good hand-sewn anarcho communist flag for outdoor use?

Second, this is mostly just to bring in discussions and talk and stuff. I'm not trying to change the world with a Reddit post. \n\nSo if you don't know about the FreeLM sub I think at first I was feeling like it was unfair and I think in some ways while I do find that it's somewhat unfair I think I didn't remember at the time what happens when a revolutionary person (and I'm not saying or not saying LM is politically revolutionary) that they're real politics become watered down. We see this with MLK for example, he's not seen as a black socialist, he's seen as the guy that made a speech one time about having a dream and that's all he is for many people. My mom who's a trump supporter seems to think that he would have been a conservative. In some ways I think that Tort got a better position than most. I mean they did get a Wikipedia page hehe. Whatever that even means for some people but my point is is that they were well known enough to hit somewhat mainstream eyes. If you type in their name on Reddit you'll see that a few communities were talking about them. I was talking to someone who is from Puerto Rico and is currently living on the mainland and he says that he heard of Tort as well although at the time they didn't really know the details of the situation. I think at the time I wanted Tort to get more attention but now I realize that that's not always the good thing because not all attention is good attention. Especially when it's a weird parasocial relationship attention where all of your baby pictures are posted stuff even when there is so far no evidence LM is guilty and the nature and conclusion of the trial does not prove without a shadow of a doubt. It just means that he is either labeled guilty or not guilty by the courts. Innocent people do get charged sometimes. It kind of reminds me of the true crime community where you have the people who are trying to treat it very seriously and be like sort of amateur detectives and tried to actually come to somewhat logical conclusions from the information that they have and then the people who post flower crowns of the shooters. \n\nAgain I'm not trying to move mountains with a Reddit post, more just curious about what other people might say in creating a sort of interesting discussion.\n\nEspecially in the topics of the liberalization of radical figures, parasocial relationships with people who are incarcerated, who are in court, or even just people who have gone down in history as doing something horrible. And also sort of the nature of privacy when you are someone who is seen as a martyr. Like I almost can't help but feel like there might be some sort of feeling of entitlement or something as if another person's entire life or history is just public domain now that person is essentially a public figure Martyr.

Especially when they target more socialist policies that largely benefit the working class.\n\n**Context:**\n\nHey all. I recently watched a few videos about how the conservative party wihtin the UK has effectively destroyed their nation in the name of budget cuts, among various other actions. Within America, we are about to have Trump take office where his cronies, in the form of DOGE (the name is an eyeroll), are planning on heavily slashing government spending, destroying many agencies in the process.\n\nThe anarchist position (based) is to eventually have a complete abolition of the state (and of capitalism as well).\n\n**My Thoughts:**\n\nIt seems like many of these cuts are to bring us to a more minarchist state, which is to say, gutting everything in the government except for the most controllling and powerful aspects of the state. These aspects being the police, prisons\/courts and military, which are, of course, the most vicious aspects of state.\n\nI don't feel like there's anything to cheer about with these governmental cuts, since it seems like many of them occur at the expense of the poor, working class, middle class and elderly individuals, while retaining the worst asepcts of the state. So how to progress?\n\n**Steps to follow (?):**\n\n1. We should vote and fight for liberal\/labour policies that maintain government spending (not that I'm a \"go out and vote!!!! liberal or anything) for public services that benefit society as a whole, specifically the working class.\n2. At the same time, we continue to target the most blatant uses of state power (police, prison\/courts and military) via actions and movements like defund the police and get rid of for-profit prisons etc. At the same time, we continue to target corporations and focus on unionization\/syndicalist efforts, alongside engaging in agorist black markets, creating communes, working to force corporations to increase pay, bring back pensions and any other activity to undermine the power of capitalists - I'm open to suggestions ;)\n\n**Outcome of Steps:**\n\nAttacking the more powerful forms of state control (police, prisons\/courts and military), will reduce the most blatant and brutal forms of state power, reducing the fear that can come from dissenting. This reduction in power will be double important for when the nearly inevitable rush to fascism occurs in response to a growing leftist sect.\n\nFurthermore, fighting to get the government to increase spending and\/or socialize healthcare, education and housing etc. will drastically increase the amount of power the working class by removing massive financial burdens.\n\nThe above, in turn, will weaken the control of capitalism on the working class, especially when we factor in direct attacks against the capitalists.\n\nThis, in turn, will create a more powerful working class, who will have an easier time attacking other forms of governmental control\u00a0*and*\u00a0capitalism.\n\nThis will fuel a continuous cycle that will eventually lead to a more anarchist form, be it communism or market anarchism or whatever.\n\nEssentially, we give the working class some wins and show them that they can operate without need for hierarchies, capitalism or a state, slowly, overtime.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nShould we be cheering these cuts to the government on, if, technically, they are reducing the power of the state?\n\nOr should we be fighting against them, since the working class and fixed income individuals are going to get hurt the hardest by cuts to certain programs?\n\nAnd\/or are we to aim to destroy the most controlling aspects of state first (being the police, prison\/courts and military)?\n\n**Disclaimer 1:**\n\nWhile I would love to reach a purely anarchist form (not sure if I'm anarcho-communist or market anarchist or... I'm still reading), I want to reach this form with the least amount of suffering involved. This is very important to me.\n\nMy biggest reason for not being an ML is related to the fact that many of these ML regimes seemingly lead the working class to their doom in the name of \"the greater good,\" and take an \"any means to the end\" approach. This is not to mention the layers of bureaucracy and power hoarding that occurs within the so-called vanguard party.\n\nI am\u00a0***NOT***\u00a0comfortable with \"sacrificing\" anyone in the name of any ideology.\n\n(Would this be characterized as \"harm reduction?\")\n\n**Disclaimer 2:**\n\nPlease forgive and correct me if I misuse certain words or misrepresent certain concepts. I'm still learning. I promise I am trying my hardest not to be a liberal sellout or reactionary apologist.

I am a public school teacher and an anarchist. I am poor, my students are poor, my students' families are poor, my country is sunk in capitalist chaos and is one of the countries with the greatest social inequality in the world. As a teacher, and as an anarchist, I try to make my students aware of this reality. I use my subject to explain inequality and show them different opportunities they have to break the cycle, to recognize generational trauma, understand themselves more, pay attention to mental health, understand how capitalism works so as not to be sucked in by the system that dehumanizes people. I do all this through demonstrations, activities, showing these opportunities in practice (usually related to undergraduate courses that these students don't have much hope of getting into through the entrance exams), making artistic graffiti projects to demonstrate cooperation and occupation of public space (we painted the school walls), among other things. It's never just a lecture telling them how they should live their lives, it's dynamic, playful, planned and smart. And yet, the amount of influence I have on these teenagers is minimal, obviously. Friends matter and know more, family influences more and even my fellow teachers end up influencing more. I don't want to be the only reference in their lives, but I often feel like I'm running into a wall, that the cruel reality around me and my students is so much more powerful than me. And also, theoretically I work for the state government, I have so much bureaucracy and responsibilities to fulfill that the little energy I have left is to do these things I said I do. And I kinda work for the government, so I feel very hypocritical, even though I know that I'm not, because I'm not a politician, a police officer or anything like that, I'm a teacher inserting myself in the public space, which is where I will have the most influence.\n\nAnd finally, what bothers me most is when I realize that I am being practically forced to replicate professional behaviors in the classroom that, if I don't use, makes it impossible for me to teach a class. For example: in some classes in some schools, if I am not stricter or do not call the school's \"authorities\" such as the principal, I simply cannot teach due to the indisposition and lack of respect I suffer from the students. This lack of interest in education and lack of respect for education professionals in my country is so strong, teachers are devalued and underpaid. and are beaten in the streets by police. It's a culture of teacher hatred in right-wing media that preaches us as indoctrinators, among other crazy things that have created this view among most students' families that school is a place to spend time and have fun with friends, studying doesn't lead to nothing. Students then arrive at school with this mentality and I understand where it all comes from, but I have less than 1 hour with them a week how am I going to explain this to a 16 year old. There's no way, so I end up shouting, taking them out of the classroom, so I can make the most of the little time I have to teach those who aren't like that. And I feel terrible. I studied so many beautiful theories about education at university and I can easily say: most of them are rubbish, all from people who have never set foot in a classroom and taught by university professors who have never even set foot in a public school. Anyway, all of this leaves me confused, angry, feeling guilty and insufficient. And all because I am a public school teacher and also an anarchist.

They gain popularity in the times of economic strife, utilising populist rhetoric to rally the masses around fascists' promises of economic revival and denouncements of ruling moderate politicians - Mussolini exploited the disillusionment and poverty of Italian WWI veterans, Hitler promised to rebuild German economy from the Great Depression and the Treaty of Versailles, Le Pen and Trump both built their support on the popular anger at the effects of neoliberal policies.\n2. They are backed by the economic elite - eg. Hitler's campaign was funded by German industrialists, while Trump's was bankrolled by Elon Musk and shielded from criticism by Jeff Bezos.\n3. They redirect the popular outrage at dire economic conditions away from the capitalist class, towards a scapegoat - for Hitler it was the Jews, the communists, the gays and the trans people, for Le Pen it is immigrants, for Trump it is the immigrants, the \"woke\" and the trans people.\n4. Once in power, they quickly abandon the facade of pro-worker economic populism and readily serve the interests of the owner class - Mussolini banned strikes and non-fascist worker syndicates, Hitler privatised most industry, Trump assembled a cabinet of billionares and multi-millionares, two of which are now in charge of de-regulating their own industries.\n\nThese facts have led me to theorise that a key function of fascism is to act as a lightning rod to capitalism - when the latter creates infuriating poverty and inequality that could result in a mass anti-capitalist revolt, fascists sweep in, backed by the funds and propaganda provided by their elite sponsors, to redirect the popular outrage towards their chosen scapegoat and seize state institutions for themselves.\n\nThis ingenious symbiosis between capitalism and fascism is quadruply dire:\n\n1. It preserves capitalism, with its exploitation and authoritarian working conditions, in spite of the popular rage instilled by its socio-economic consequences.\n2. It bolsters capitalism moreso than typical liberalism does, by placing authoritarians indebted to their corporate sponsors (or said corporate sponsors themselves) in key regulatory positions within state bureaucracy.\n3. It causes severe, often lethal systemic violence towards members of the scapegoat group.\n4. It turns otherwise decent people into bigoted lunatics, through repeated exposure to conspiracy theories propagandised by corporate and, following a fascist takeover, state actors, for the benefit of both actors.\n\na"},{"created_date":"2025-01-11T16:03:18.000","sentiment_score":-0.9987863898,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"former usmc cbrne expert who decided to change sides I was formerly a usmc infantryman and cbrne expert from cbirf.. ive seen and took part in things so horrendous most of you probably wouldn't believe me if I told you..\n\nI was a part of occupy wallstreet, occupy sandy and standing rock.

Sorry for not specifying earlier. I suppose I'm a victim of the same US-centered thinking I loathe :-)\n\n\n\nHi everyone! A confluence of recent events, both at the national level, as well as within my own little city have led me to believe that people are more receptive than at any time in my life to the ideas of the \"left\" (socialism, communism, anarchism, etc.)\n\nI'm 38, so I remember following No WTO protests through punk bands that were vocal about it, the 'war on terror', Occupy, DAPL, BLM, the 2016 race where Bernie seemed credible as a national candidate, Trump, and I'm probably forgetting other formative events).\n\nI grew up working class with parents who voted both Democrat and Republican. They always seemed to have a heavy dose of cynicism and skepticism toward politics and mainly voted exclusively in presidential elections. But I remember saying to my dad once, when I was 8 or 9, something like \"you vote Democrat because Republicans are for rich people and Democrats are for poor people, and we're poor\". I still remember his response: \"No, they are both for rich people\".\n\nOver the years, culture wars and disinformation led my parents to become Trump voters, and here is my main 'thesis': I believe that the *some* of the same energy that exists among Trump voters could be tapped into by those of us with more fair-minded, egalitarian points of view.\n\nFor instance, my city has a problem with our police force being violent and unchecked, with the worst of their crimes being exploitation of sex workers. I had a conversation with my mom about it, mentioning I'd gone to our city council to complain about it, and she told me that back when she was a kid, women knew not to go into certain towns alone, for fear of sexual violence from predatory cops. This really made me feel like there could be some common ground regarding distrust of authority and breaking destructive power structures.\n\nSeeing so many people vote Trump at the same time that Luigi Mangione became a folk hero (I am into anarchy &amp; **peace**, btw) made me realize that there is a massive amount of people that are dissatisfied with the status quo. While I obviously loathe Trump, and believe he has hurt and will hurt many people, perhaps for decades to come, I believe that he reflects a mirror back on the worst parts of American life. He should annex Canada and Greenland, if only to make it clear to the world that yes, the western world is basically ruled by the USA, the nefarious hegemon, due to our excessive military spending as well as our highly consumerist culture that makes us the trough-slurping pigs of the world, while allowing an underclass within our own borders to suffer under the covers.\n\nI believe that if we keep preaching things like distrust of authority, breaking sick power structures, and try to move away from all these tired left-right, Democrat-Republican, false dichotomies, we may be able to reach some allies among Trump voters and people that identify as right-wing or conservative.\n\n**TL;DR: Shared distrust of authority, coupled with a growing awareness of systemic failures, presents an opportunity. By focusing on dismantling oppressive structures and challenging the tired left-right paradigm, we can build bridges with those who, despite their support for Trump, yearn for a more just and equitable society, by engaging in honest, empathetic dialogue that centers on shared values and a collective vision for a better future.**"},{"created_date":"2025-01-09T15:30:05.000","sentiment_score":-0.9874973297,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"I made up my own quote I wanna get on a T-Shirt and I\u2019m curious what you all think It\u2019s \u201cThe law is nothing but a tool.

Our main project is cooking fresh, nutritious meals for unsheltered folks each week, and we also have a propane program where folks can get free propane to stay warm\/cook. We also distribute harm reduction, clothes, etc. \n\nI've recently been exposed to critiques of the mutual aid project from the socialist\/Marxist point of view. I know one common critique is that much of what is packaged as mutual aid often isn't very mutual, which I think is a valid point-my group is always brainstorming ways to be more truly mutual, such as giving opportunities to the our unsheltered neighbors to come help cook and distribute meals (to the extent that they want to, not as an obligation). That being said, I think even when mutual aid is fairly one-sided, the distinction between how a horizontally-organized, no-strings attached project operates and a neoliberal charity or church is significant enough that I don't have a huge problem with the phrase \"mutual aid.\"\n\nThe critique that has given me more food for thought is over strategy. The arguments I've seen say that mutual aid is essentially just a band-aid that doesn't address root issues, which frankly I think is a pretty uncontroversial thing to say that no one I know in the MA world would disagree with. Where I understand the point is that maintaining a well-functioning mutual aid group is incredibly time intensive, and in theory that time could be spent helping politically organize in a way that would more directly grasp for the levers of power that could ultimately redistribute wealth in a way that would benefit far more people far more greatly than cooking meals every week ever could. \n\nI have access to wealth and have donated a lot of money to more root-cause political projects, but realistically I work full time and contribute what free time I can to MA because I like being involved in my neighbors and because it helps people in the here and now. Part of this is admittedly a bit selfish: I get more satisfaction from MA than I have from helping with political projects, which is important for my mental health as an individual in our capitalist society. I also love being part of a community that takes care of each other, though I've heard socialists critique the focus on community over the focus on a society and the idea that MA groups are little islands of solidarity whereas the Marxist project is to unite the working class across the country and world towards a common cause. One thing I feel is missing from this aspect of the Marxist critique is that in my experience, lots of trans folks are attracted to mutual aid (I'm a cis-male, for what it's worth), and I think part of the reason it speaks more to them is that our \"society\" is largely very hostile to them, and while I'm all about class solidarity, this a reality for a lot of marginalized people that I don't often see addressed from the Marxist lens.\n\nAnyways, this is kind of a jumble of thoughts, but just wanted to see what people who are more anarchist-inclined like myself think about these critiques of MA. Would our time be better spent on political projects that have the possibility of achieving a greater good, and if so, what would that practically even look like?"},{"created_date":"2025-01-08T15:10:19.000","sentiment_score":-0.9942570329,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Looking for 2025 calendar that will support a cause.

Happiness is a product of our quality of life. That's why Danes are happier than Greeks. Danes are asked: \"what is the secret of happiness?\", but they never give the right answer: purchasing power. Material comfort, but only if it is generalized in society, because the perception of poverty causes sorrow even in the souls of the rich. That's why rich South-Africans, Hispanics, and Chinese can't have peace and live in fear, and flee their countries to live in Copenhagen and Zurich.\n\nWe are told the opposite so we look within ourselves for what is to blame for our misery, so we do not attempt to change our circumstances but rather live and die doubly miserable, tortured not only by want but also by an unfounded guilt, as unhappiness is seen as a failure, a character flaw, and not as a symptom of living in a bleak and diseased World; so that we do not understand that, in order to be happy, we must make our societies more like Danish and Norweigian societies.\n\nAnd that means revolution. It means dispossessing the rich from the means of production they have hoarded and distribute them among the workers.

Think of this as an investment in social change, and let yourself dream that it's possible things could get better again if we work together.\nJoin the conversation !\n#### [Just Wondering...](https:\/\/justwondering.io\/)\nIn 2024 we worked on two long-form animated essays which both required quite a bit of research! The first one, \u201cEscape, Resistance and Solidarity - Farmed Animal Sanctuaries as the Heart of the Movement\u201d is an exploration of the solidarity we can extend to (exploited\/farmed) non-human animals through the sanctuary movement and beyond it. The second, \u201cNatural Gas, The Bridge To Climate Disaster\u201d narrates the lies the fossil fuel industry has been telling us for decades to keep us hooked on what they\u2019re selling; it\u2019s also a dedication to climate activists everywhere. Before working on these two, we created three video-poems in solidarity with Palestine which were screened at a few fundraisers. We also held a speculative workshop imagining multispecies education, got the 2024 Jen Angel Anarchist Media Grant, made new stickers and a zine based on one of our animated essays! For 2025 we have another two long-form animated essays already planned - this time, they are both somewhat related to animal politics and animal liberation, from different angles. And we hope we\u2019ll be able to make some more video-poems for Palestine as well and continue working on the drafts we started sometime ago! Every year we have bigger expectations than what we actually manage to do, but this is what keeps us going.\n#### Anarchist Wiki\nAbout half a year ago I started the AnarWiki project ago to preserve a previous attempt at an Anarchist Wiki which was taken off the web (just after being vandalised by Tankies). Subsequently I added some articles from other sources, and made the mistake of trying to import some from Wikipedia (wasted too much time try to fix templates for too little benefit). I\u2019ve been a little sad that there haven\u2019t been other volunteers, but also haven\u2019t made many people aware of it, as I didn\u2019t feel it was quite good enough to launch yet. I\u2019ve also been distracted with pro-Anarchist blog posts and my \u2018Reasons To Hate Capitalism\u2019 series (video version coming soon), which have been more popular than I\u2019ve expected. See this substack In the new year I expect to spend more time on the Wiki, as I believe it could be an important resource, and hope to help get it to a place that others want to be involved, as I feel its also important to be a shared responsibility.\n#### Graphic commune (Samikata)\nI've joined AF2C mid spring and shortly began to collaborate in the propaganda &amp; graphics communes, as well as Well4Ward not too long afterwards. Through the few months here I've created multiple posters including full fledged artworks, which, while outside my comfort zone, definitely helped me to work on my art skills and try different approaches to design. The animation for Well4ward in particular has had a major impact on my capabilities and I feel like it has improved my stroke confidence by a mile. Overall I'm glad I'm here and I hope to be able to contribute more in the coming months. I've met quite a few kind comrades here and hopefully will meet many more in the future.\n### **TL;DR : Let\u2019s Build Together**\nIn one year, we\u2019ve connected initiatives, built tools for change, and started federating communes.\nAre you tired of watching the world crumble?

I think there's a recent tendency to be just techno-pessimistic these days all over, because all the benefits naturally benefit state and capital under this system.\n\nI am new to anarchism, but I was thinking about how you could allocate scarce and valuable resources to important, societal projects. Listening to David Graeber's convo with Peter Thiel about the future (this is one of the most interesting conversations I've ever heard [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eF0cz9OmCGw&amp;ab\\_channel=GraeberWave](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eF0cz9OmCGw&amp;ab_channel=GraeberWave) ) was really inspiring to the notion that Anarchism could scale very well, and actually be used to create technology in a more efficient way than capital accumulation. \n\nLike in a global anarchist scenario what if you used blockchain technologies to give people 5 (example number) monthly \"votes\" toward resource devotion for big projects -- say a goal, eg solving climate change or going to mars.

Let me explain more.\n\n**Mccarthism and fear of North Korean fifth column**\n\nSince 1953, South Korea has been under threat of North Korean attack. And since North Korea is a state capitalist (in other words, state wage slavery) state, Mccarthism is common in South Korea. Korean militarist tyrants, such as [Pak Ch\u014fng-H\u016di](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Park_Chung_Hee), [Ch\u014fn Tu-Hwan](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chun_Doo-hwan) and [No T'ae-U](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roh_Tae-woo), have brainwashed Koreans that **SOCIALISM = COMMUNISM = ML = STALINISM = NORTH KOREA = DICTATORSHIP = TOTALITARIANISM**. Even the concepts of Nordic Model or social democracy are shunned here. (I hate those ideas too. No matter how generous your tyrant is, you are still a slave.)\n\n**Normalization of control**\n\nDue to long-term dictatorship here, control of state and police is normal here. Guns are nearly 100% forbidden, and worker strike or demonstration is often accused of \"NK and Chinese agents that try to spread chaos in society\". If you bring the ideas of squatting or illegalism here, well... good luck.\n\n**Social Darwinism**\n\nOur social studies textbooks teach us that capitalism lets you earn what you deserve, based on your talents and efforts. If you search on slum and the homeless on Internet, they are like, \"Well, you should have studied hard in your youth\" or \"So what? You want to steal our private property for your welfare?\". Such ideas were especially promoted during military dictatorship period, when South Korea had to exploit her people as hard as possible in order to be a developed country. \n\n**Hostility on femenism and idpol**\n\nTo satisfy our complaints on social injustice, [liberals](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Democratic_Party_(South_Korea,_2015)) have made some lipservices - there are [Ministry of Gender Equality and Family](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ministry_of_Gender_Equality_and_Family) and many feminist organizations. However, most of them are TERF and selective feminists. When they illegalized the pornography while advocating male only military conscription, many people started believing that feminism = female supremarcy. Not only feminism but also whole liberal idpol is despised by many young (20-39) men, and [centrist conservatives](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Reform_Party_(South_Korea)) got much popularity via anti-feminism.\n\n**Sabotage of ML**\n\nMany leftist areas, such as parties, NGOs and labor unions are overrun by MLs such as [Progressive Party](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Progressive_Party_(South_Korea,_2017)) so libertarian socialists have little place here.\n\n**Christian fundamentalism**\n\nAlthough I am a born Protestant (Presbyterian) Christian and attend to Church every week, I should admit that Christian fundamentalism is severe here. Due to influence of American evangelicalism, many Christian organizations here - notably Esther Prayer Movement (\uc5d0\uc2a4\ub354\uae30\ub3c4\uc6b4\ub3d9\ubcf8\ubd80) and InterCP(\uc778\ud130\ucf65) - are based on fundamental ideas. You can see Korean flag, American flag, Israeli flag and cross together in many South Korean far-right marches and demonstration. While Christian rate is roughly 25% in South Korea, fundamentalist ideas such as Homophobia, Islamophobia and patriarchy are widely spread. Can you believe that there is only one church (\uc12c\ub3cc\ud5a5\ub9b0\uad50\ud68c, Sumdol Presbyterian Church) that openly welcomes LGBTs, and it is designated as a heretic church by roughly half of South Korean Protestant churches?\n\nDespite these adversities and hardships, I am convinced that we - not only South Koreans but also our compatriots in North Korea - will, with the help from companions in Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mongolia, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines, etc., create humanity's happiness for ourselves and all. In 1198, [Man J\u014fk](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Manjeok) fought right in this land against class system, and in 1812, [Hong Ky\u014fng-Rae](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hong_Gyeong-rae) rose up here against feudalist exploitation. We are descendants of Man J\u014fk, Hong Ky\u014fng-Rae, [Kim Chwa-Chin](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kim_Chwa-chin), and [Yi Hoe-Y\u014fng](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lee_Hoe-yeong), and **we will let the people command and the government obey!**"},{"created_date":"2025-01-04T07:57:25.000","sentiment_score":0.9994435906,"sentiment_label":"POSITIVE","text":"What's striking about the manifesto left by the Trump supporter who shot himself and set his truck on fire outside the Trump hotel in Las Vegas is that the desire to harm others merges with the urge to self-destruction.

Noise Demo\/Rally Saturday Jan 4th at 1pm THE CITY OF ELGIN HAS \nDECLARED WAR \nAGAINST ALL UNHOUSED PEOPLE\nIT\u2019S TIME TO FIGHT BACK!.\n\nOn the night of December 19th, 2024, in a city hall courtroom of only a handful of people, Elgin city council members approved and celebrated a plan to eliminate \u201cTent City\u201d, along with all other tents and self-made structures that act as shelter made by those living on the streets. This plan was discussed and decided on without the knowledge or presence of the hundreds of houseless people living in Elgin.\n\n\u201cTent City\u201d, located on roughly 8 acres between the Fox River and Route 31 in Elgin, has been a site used for encampments by people experiencing houselessness ever since the demolition of a metal fabrication factory there back in 1990. For many of these residents, this is the only space in the city that offers safety and accommodations that allow them autonomy over their lives. With this autonomy, the residents of Tent City have spent time and energy over the years building and sustaining this community. \n\nThe City of Elgin plans to evict all residents of Tent City, along with the hundreds of other houseless individuals residing in tents and self-made structures around the city of Elgin, moving only 50 of them to the Lexington Inn &amp; Suites for a duration of four months. This hotel is widely known for bed bug and cockroach infestations, along with sanitary conditions that only barely meet city code.\n\nThere is currently no plan for housing after the four months has ended. \n\u201cWe know this is a temporary solution,\u201d Assistant City Manager Karina Nava said. \n\nALL houseless individuals, including those selected for the four-month stay at the hotel, are ordered to immediately vacate the premises of their encampment or face trespassing charges. After every resident is evicted from \u201cTent City\u201d in particular, the \u201csite will be secured\u201d and \u201ccleared and remediated\u201d. Furthermore, the city promises to instate a \u2018zero tolerance policy\u2019 for any future tents and self-made shelters, leaving those who are unable to access options provided by the city at extreme risk to the impending winter temperatures presently and long-term.\n\nRather than meeting houseless people where they are, where they feel safe, and investing in resources that could help them re-build after two recent fires, the City of Elgin would rather spend more money and resources by evicting them all, subjecting them to the trauma of forced displacement. Parks Superintendent Greg Hulke estimated the cost of the eviction and clearing to be between $2 million and $2.5 million, with the process taking two to four months, not including the cost of the relocation of the selected 50 residents.\n\nWhile \u201csafety\u201d has been said to be the reason for all of this, it is abundantly clear that the real motive is the same beautification process seen happening in many other gentrified cities. What this eviction plan fails to reveal is an anti-homelessness motive integrated into the city\u2019s vision of boosting property value. \n.\nElgin Police Chief Ana Lalley said the department will begin the process on or about Jan. 20.  \nThe unhoused people of Elgin deserve the autonomy to determine their own living situations.\nThis plan is not a rescue \u2013 it is an eviction, and for many people, it may be a death sentence. \n\nDEFEND THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN SOCIETY \nFROM LOSING WHAT LITTLE THEY HAVE LEFT\n\nJOIN US FOR A RALLY SATURDAY JANUARY 4TH \n@ 1PM @ THE CORNER OF E.

[Kim Chwa-Chin](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kim_Chwa-chin) and his crews made an autonomous zone in Korean diaspora in Manchuria, and there was even a small [secret guerilla army](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heroic_Corps).\n\nAfter the independence, all the South Korean politicians - [left-wing nationalists](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Progressive_Party_(South_Korea,_2017)), [centrist](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Democratic_Party_(South_Korea,_2015)) [liberals](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rebuilding_Korea_Party), [centrist conservatives](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Reform_Party_(South_Korea)) and [hard-line conservatives](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/People_Power_Party_(South_Korea)) have acknowledged anarchist roles in Korean independence. Just... just recall how Ukrainian far-rights try to downplay Makhnovshchina as if it was just a Ukrainian anti-Russian nationalist organization. The same thing has happened in South Korea for 70 years, especially because South Korea had to \"prove\" to Korean Diasporas ( [Chaoxianzu](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_Chinese), [Zainichi](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Koreans_in_Japan), etc ) that South Korea is legitimate Korea, and North Korea has to do nothing with Korean independence activities.\n\nHowever, things have changed when Yoon Seok-Yeol, a supporter of [New-Right](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Right_(South_Korea)), came to power. As you see in the article, [New-Rights ](https:\/\/namu.wiki\/w\/%EB%89%B4%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8(%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD))believe that [Korea before the occupation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_Empire) was a feudal state that deserved to collapse, and that Japanese Empire came to Korea to \"modernize\" and \"industrialize\" Korea. (Just like how Chinese propaganda says about Tibet) They believe that Korean independence activists were \"terrorists\", and that their modern counterpart is North Korea. They say that they are \"anti-nationalists that fight against chauvinists\", but they uphold Japanese nationalism.\n\nSo, with fascists like this, Yoon Seok-Yeol tried to denounce Korean anarchism and its legacy. [They tried to remove the busts of various independence activists, including Kim Chwa-Chin, from Korea Military Academy](https:\/\/english.hani.co.kr\/arti\/english_edition\/english_editorials\/1106781.html). They said that they were alleged of collaborating with \"commies\", despite **Kim Chwa-Chin having been assassinated by an ML!** Even[ Lee Hoe-Yeong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lee_Hoe-yeong), another anarchist, was considered a \"commie\".\n\nOther three  independence activists - who were not anarchists - were accused of \"being communists\" as well.

Also, Hong Beom-Do died before North Korea was established, so he has nothing with North Korea. **But all of five were accused of \"reds\".**\n\nIn contrast, South Korean dictator [Park Chung-Hee](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Park_Chung_Hee), the greatest idol of South Korean conservatives and New-rights, participated in [Worker's Party of South Korea](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Workers%27_Party_of_South_Korea) in late 1940s.

When people ask what they can do to contribute practically as anarchists, the usual answers seem to be, join or start a local mutual aid network, or look for your local Food Not Bombs group. \n\nHistorically (here I'm thinking 1860s to the late 1930s), anarchist practice had two main strands:\n\n- building support networks that could replace existing hierarchies \n- education, agitation and propaganda \n\nBoth libertarian and state socialists were using education, agitation and propaganda in the decades leading up to and after WWI. In practice, this involved organising talks and debates at social clubs, village halls or union meetings, talking at public speaking pitches, putting up posters and distributing socialist newspapers and socialist literature. \n\nThe environment these activists were working in was completely different to the modern world. With no TV or internet, people voluntarily went out to hear activists speak, just because it was something interesting to do. In some places, public speaking pitches were almost competitive arenas, with speakers vying for the largest crowd. Everything was new and people were often fighting for basic rights. People weren't yet jaded by the failure of unions or socialist parties to deliver on their promises.\n\nNowadays, we have an almost unlimited worldwide audience for propaganda and education, but it is easily eclipsed by all the other noise. Films, TV, internet, and the ever present advertising of consumer goods. In most developed countries, people aren't fighting for basic working rights or a basic standard of living. The nuclear family and home entertainment have drastically reduced the amount of time people socialise in public or communal spaces.\n\nModern anarchist propaganda often seems to take the form of \"subvertising\" or similar stunts that subvert the language and tools of consumerism. To me, this seems to be preaching to the converted, and not effective at conveying a message to ordinary working people. \n\nAre the approaches to education, agitation and propaganda that were effective 100 years ago relevant today? If not, what is?"},{"created_date":"2024-12-29T10:09:22.000","sentiment_score":0.9887612462,"sentiment_label":"POSITIVE","text":"A little lane, and hedges leafing: England and the need for a right to roam "},{"created_date":"2024-12-29T05:48:29.000","sentiment_score":-0.9994184971,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"I can't help but feel like it is somewhat unfair that LM is getting all of this attention and Tortuguita is not.

But I think it's much more as a state of being. Because power is like cancer, it can corrupt a society coming from anywhere. It can be through charisma, brute force, personal connections. It can be trying to maintain an organization or position long after it's socially useful. The corruption of institutions. It's always there, there's no point where it's permanently defeated. \n\nBut we evolved psychological immune responses to it, so we root for the underdog, distrust the powerful, ... and I believe being an anarchist is being very deliberate about it, strategizing, and collaborating to fight power without the aim of taking it for yourself. But it also needs creative aims, positive goals, so it's worth fight for and doesn't devolve into pure reactionary violence.\n\nAnd it's important to have a sense of priority. Different groups are always vying for power, and a risk for the anarchist is going against the already weaker group, helping the stronger one just take over. When the spanish come to your land, it's probably not the best time to riot against tribal leaders or stop making weapons.\n\nRight now, we have the richest men in the world, the president of the most powerful country, most big names in \"decentralized finance\" in a small connected clique. \n\n\"*The ability to move money fluidly* and the erosion of the nation-state are closely related\", Peter Thiel said, as he joined with Elon Musk to try and allow everyone to move money fluidly.   \n\"We will coup whoever we want!

These are strange times. It may well be that the end of the state, at this moment, would be the worst thing to ever happen to anarchism.\n\nWith enough technological superiority, the rules of the WTO on IP, we may end up in a stable de facto world government, and because the violence is outsourced to the state\/local elites\/PMCs and the information is filtered by big tech, we don't even see how it went wrong or who to fight. If we even have the means to do so. Other than MAYBE China or the EU, I think no one can pose challenges without a coup, corruption charges, a forex crisis, the opposition suddenly swimming in money, ... . But the natural resources are de jure under democratic control in most of the world and preserving it has a decent support. People can control data, information flow, ecosystems, communities.

I only have the rough prototype but it includes some of the following:\n\nCYA: For all intents and purposes, this is a work of satire.\n\n\\- Media and Revolution: A section that describes how media has subtly and intentionally poorly represented relatable instances of revolution and revolutionaries in order to poison the mind of the modern revolutionary.\n\n\\- Disarming the Revolution: A section that describes how modern media has fooled society-at-large into believing that bashing is never the answer, and how we should always try to cooperate with the oppressor instead of bashing them. This section also goes over using bashing as a means of furthering the cause over random acts of senseless bashing.\n\n\\- The Revolution and Its People: A section going over unity amongst revolutionaries. Encourages looking past the small disagreements in prospect of us all having the same goal. This section also goes over how to break people out of the web of lies our modern politicians and corporations have stuck us all in.\n\n\\- The Revolution and Education: A section that talks about education and college. Encourages others to post any and all information online, in order to begin the long path destroying the concept of colleges by putting the knowledge in the hands of the people, free of charge.\n\n\\- Revolutionary Politics: A section that covers the meaninglessness of parties and how taking sides in the modern political sphere is working with the oppressor. Encourages breaking from \"the two big parties\" and abandoning the political compass, as they're both tools used to divide us.\n\nI will have another work in the future that expands upon this should it get enough attention called A Modern Revolution in Action.\n\nWhat is the general consensus here? I want this to be a field manual for those wanting to bring people into being revolutionaries or at least advocates for it."},{"created_date":"2024-12-25T16:04:06.000","sentiment_score":-0.9988547564,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":" New Danish community for anarchists and other libertarian socialist on Reddit I am starting a danish speaking online community on Reddit for anarchists and libertarian socialists because there's a lack of spaces to discuss these ideas in this language.  \n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/anarkistforum\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/anarkistforum\/)"},{"created_date":"2024-12-25T17:18:47.000","sentiment_score":-0.9931957722,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Maybe You're Not an Introvert.

Every prison is a little different and so each person will have their own rules about sending things like letters and packages so make sure you do your research before sending anything. This is important because anytime you mess up at best it means that the package or delivery will just be sent back and at worst it could mean that the prisoner themselves could be punished. At worst worst you could be punished but very unlikely unless of course you send something illegal. So do some research into the prison and their rules, they have rules so look them up.\n\n# Letters \n\nLetters are the most basic thing you can send and letters are fun to get. You should know that prisoners often when they send letters back they have to send it with their own post stamps and those cost money inside the prison so if you don't get a message back it's nothing personal it's probably just because they can't afford it, they're too busy, or they have too many letters to respond to. But that is okay. You should also know that prison guards typically remove the envelope and the letter from each other because they have to open the letter and read it themselves first. This causes some problems such as the fact that the envelope gets separated meaning that anything you write on the envelope will not be necessarily given to the prisoner. If you want to return address put it in the letter itself. If you send anything like photographs, make sure to number all of the photographs and then in the letter itself inventory all of the photographs. When it comes to the letters number the letters like this \"\\#\\# out of [total]\" this is so they know how many letters there were total and what number the letter currently is. This is so if the letters ever get lost which if they're read by the guards they might the prisoner will know which letters are missing. It's helpful because they could try to petition to have them. Check the rules of the prison as I already said because sometimes there are different rules about the restrictions on letters. Sometimes these restrictions make no sense but they have to be followed anyway. Restrictions on color, restrictions on whether or not you can print on both sides of a page, the number of pages you can send total, all of these things could be restrictions depending on the prison. Check the rules first.\n\n# Etiquette \n\nWhen it comes to letter etiquette there are also different rules to follow. The first thing is do not talk about the crime that they had committed. Don't do that. First off if they have not been sentenced yet and are still awaiting trial then it could be a problem for them. Don't do it it puts them in a weird position. Second even if they do get charged it's still a really weird position to put them in because it's very personal as well as the fact that they may not want to talk about it. If they want to talk about it then that's different but don't ask them about it. Instead talk about other things. It's okay to talk about other stuff about the prison, you don't need to pretend that they're not prisoners but don't talk about their crime, and don't talk about any other illegal activity either. Remember, anything you say will be read by the guards. This is also one of the reasons why when you send letters it will take a while for them be able to be read by the prisoner because they have to be read by the guards and if your letter is 1 in 1000 letters, it's going to take a while. \n\n# Packages \n\nWho doesn't love a surprise package? Prisoners. The thing is is that surprises are not really the best thing for prisoners. You because when you surprise a prisoner you end up typically actually surprising the guards. Prisoners can be punished for things like the books that you send or the the gifts that you give. If you want to give a gift sometimes there are organizations out there that are things like books behind bars or some kind of organization like that and they are dedicated to providing approved books to prisoners. There are probably organizations out there to help give approved to gifts for prisoners.\n\n# Phone calls\n\nWhen it comes to LM it's very unlikely that you'll be able to call him however when it comes to other prisoners you may be interested in corresponding with, prisoners typically have a call list and they will put people on that call list. The prisoner can put people on that call list such as family and friends. If you're not on the list you will not be approved when you call the prison. If you are not on the call list or they don't put you on the call list don't take it personally, it's because they don't have space or they're trying to save that space for someone else. Also they have to pay for their own minutes. \n\n# Money \n\nOkay maybe you want to give money to LM instead. Maybe he could use it to buy things. That's a nice thing to do but the problem is is that one there is a cap on the amount of money that you can put on someone's books which means account but also don't give them too much money because if a prisoner has too much money they can end up being a Target in prison because once it starts getting around that person has a lot of money they could be targeted by other prisoners to essentially try to give them things. And the thing is that at least in the US male prisons are especially violent. A lot more than female prisons apparently. So yeah probably don't put money on people's accounts without asking.\n\n# Other \n\nI don't really know where to put this information but I also just want to share some personal experience that I have when it comes to how restrictive the rules for sending letters can be sometimes. When I was involved in a different political movement and there were people who were arrested on bogus charges relating to the violation of their civil rights, and this was happening in Atlanta Georgia, restrictions involved requiring special USPS postal paper. So it had to be pre-stamped postal paper from USPS and it couldn't be anything else. It was really that restrictive. This meant that if you didn't send a letter on that little piece of paper that was no bigger than a napkin folded mind you, and it had a pre-printed stamp on so they were prepaid, then the prison would not accept it. Do I think that they made this rule specifically to make it harder to send to those prisoners? Absolutely, I absolutely think so. That was not a normal rule and I know that for the most part when it comes to sending letters to prisoners that rule is not in place. If you go on to websites to write to prisoners you will not find that rule. That was a rule that I believe they implemented because of the nature of those people. So watch out."},{"created_date":"2024-12-23T22:37:49.000","sentiment_score":-0.9893863201,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Is Wikipedia the model for an anarchist system?  https:\/\/the-lessthannothing.blogspot.com\/2024\/02\/the-wikipedia-commune.html\n\nThis article from Less Than Nothing discusses the merits of Wikipedia\u2019s open source and largely unregulated system, as it relates to an anarchist system."},{"created_date":"2024-12-23T21:39:42.000","sentiment_score":0.9365735054,"sentiment_label":"POSITIVE","text":"Automating the death panels: AI in the health insurance business Hey all, I work in \"AI\" and in light of current events, wanted to write about AI in health insurance and how f'ed up it is.

From ~1895 to ~1908 a weekly paper was published in Italian called La Questione Sociale with the subtitle \"Periodico Socialista-Anarchico\". I read somewhere online that approximately 2000 copies were printed weekly, I'm not sure of the truth to this claim but considering there were at least hundreds of anarchists in Paterson during this time period it sounds reasonable.\n\nIn 1908 this publication was banned from circulation, and renamed until an FBI raid in 1920 completely seems to have seized the operation. \n\nI would like to see if there is any way to find\/retrieve any copies of this publication. I can't seem to find a single issue.

A full revolution against capitalism in America is a risky move. Considering that revolutions are bigger and more complicated then pop culture portrays them as. And France and Russia learned that the hard way when they just replaced one tyranny with another. So, if a full revolution becomes necessary, what do you think are the big mistakes France and Russia made in their revolutions that America should avoid? Here are three I have right now.\n\n1. Reliance on strongmen. People like Robespierre, Stalin, all initiallt presented themselves as ideal for the revolution. But either revealed their true nature over time, or got greedy. We in America MUST watch out for potential strongmen within our own ranks. If any are found, they should either be removed, or monitored VERY closely.\n2. Scapegoating. One of the saddest characters in the French Revolution, was Marie Antoinette. She was a favorite scapegoat in the French Revolution with propaganda portraying her as a thrifty spender and the infamous \"Let them eat cake.\" fiasco. In truth, she had VERY little power within her own social group, her husband made most of the poor decisions, and she NEVER said \"Let them eat cake.\" This is a reminder that even the rich have their hierarchies and those with little power among them. Plus, the French Revolution was rather infamous for misogyny. So we MUST NOT allow rich women to create misogyny. Perhaps some rehabilitation sessions could help?\n3. Killing children. Everyone knows of the tragic deaths of the Romanov children. And rich children were also slaughtered without mercy in the French Revolution as well. Spoiled brats or not, children don't deserve death. Perhaps some special schools or education sessions to integrate them into a more egalitarian society could be of use? Adoption should also be on the shelf but only for very specific circumstances. Additionally, we should also note if any rich children are the victims of parental abuse.\n\nDoes anyone else know of any notable mistakes made all those centuries ago and ways to avoid them?"},{"created_date":"2024-12-20T11:21:42.000","sentiment_score":-0.9983141422,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Seeking ideas for a thought experiment about nonviolence Hello,\n\nApologies if I have misread the rules and this post is inappropriate here (I couldn't find anything specifically against it).\n\nThe thought experiment is this: suspend all disbelief and imagine getting entirely rid of humans' capacity for physical violence. In an instant, every person becomes incapable of hitting, stabbing, shooting, forcefully grabbing, etc. Violence just becomes impossible for us, no loopholes. Can't harm people, can't harm other animals either (though they can still hurt us).\n\nIn such an improbable scenario, I believe humanity would \"naturally\" end up organising itself along anarchist principles. If no one can be forced, then how could it be otherwise? I'm extremely pessimistic about our species in the real world, but in this fictional one I can't see how authoritarians could possibly keep ruling the world. We'd have to peacefully cooperate and share resources equitably and all contribute as best we can. Is this naive or short-sighted? \n\nSure, at first the rich and most middle class would freak out about their stuff getting redistributed (I think the term they would use is \"egregiously stolen by terrorists\" or something like that), and could try to go on punitive expeditions, destroying houses and things, but that could only go on for so long, and they are so vastly outnumbered there could be effective community organising to peacefully prevent most mass destruction. \n\nIn such a world, stores get emptied out quickly... but unless you hide the stuff super well, anybody can take it, even if you try to hoard. Which eventually leads to people avoiding pointless effort and instead agreeing collectively to share what there is, and share in the burden of producing what is needed.  \n\nThe current economic system should collapse quickly, because the 5% of the population already actively trying to disrupt capitalism despite the risk to their safety and freedom would become unstoppable. And they'd be joined by tons of cowards like me who are not doing anything now but would jump at the chance if it was consequence-free (no getting killed or maimed, no jail). You could sabotage every polluting company, block major roads, ports, airports, etc. nobody could stop you. So the demands of workers and ecologists would have to be met, one way or another. \n\nOn the other hand, what are fascists going to do? Try to steal my kids' favourite plush toy to hurt their feelings? I'll follow them home and do the same to their stuff haha. Am I lacking imagination here? What would the far right do in this event? What could do they do against us that wouldn't automatically be turned against them? I know they're nihilistic, but how long would they keep trying to burn the world down if their efforts were always crushed by a handful of dedicated activists? If all pipelines and oil rigs are destroyed (and I firmly believe they quickly would be), how can an oil company survive? Same for all other mass polluters and exploiters.\n\nI've long been attempting to finish my novel that tells the story of the days, weeks, months after this event. I've got many drafts but I struggle to complete them, and it might be that I need a reality check on my basic assumptions. Or rather, simply new perspectives on how things might evolve in such a scenario. To be clear I'm not even really aiming for realism (I'm not smart\/dedicated enough for that), it's more of a fun comedy with hopefully strong anarchist vibes, but still, the societal angle feels crucial to me. I just wish that part of my story was better, fuller.\n\nAny thought you can spare would help, thanks!"},{"created_date":"2024-12-20T11:19:10.000","sentiment_score":-0.9929243326,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"They tried to shame and parade him to the public, they only made him look more gangster.

For digital posters. Thats way its easier to spread the word and can accumulate a mass of followers much faster into the resistance. \n\nI personally came to call the resistance \"crush Pierre\". It is to wage counter propaganda campaign against them with intellectualism style propaganda that is to rhe betterment of the individuals well being and not an unjust authority figure. That is the intention. I firmly belive intellectualism is one of the biggest threats to fascists. They have tried to hard to protect their safe echochambers where moderates have remained brainwashed. No one is breaking the pattern.\n\nOne commenter going against them is like removing a single brick from their skyscraper (pierres x for example). They just come back and replace that brick right after. But if we get a bunch of concentrated counter propaganda on particular targets, its like us constantly removing bricks. Eventually that skyscraper is going to come collapsing down. And we can help shift the current global trend of democratic backslide.\n\nThey want us to think its futile i promise! But i personally believe this is one of their greatest weaknesses. Why else did Hitler destroy intellectualism? It was a threat to his power.\n\nBrothers and sister its important.

It is peaceful, and contributes well to the cause of achieving equality. \n\nSo if anyone would like to help let me know. The posters dont have to be complicated.

Born in 1853 in Italy, Malatesta dedicated his life to challenging oppressive systems and fighting for a society built on freedom, solidarity, and mutual aid.\n\nMalatesta\u2019s vision of anarchism went beyond mere philosophy\u2014he believed it was a practical and achievable way of life. In this episode, we explore:\n\n* His critiques of government as inherently oppressive and exploitative.\n* His rejection of reformism and calls for grassroots, bottom-up revolution.\n* His innovative ideas on **anarchist communism**, where cooperation replaces competition and decentralized, voluntary organization takes the place of hierarchical rule.\n* His emphasis on non-violence and education, advocating for revolutionary consciousness as the foundation for change.\n\nWe also dive into Malatesta\u2019s personal story:\n\n* His work as a laborer, which grounded him in the struggles of the working class.\n* His participation in uprisings, exile, and imprisonment as a revolutionary nomad.\n* His unwavering belief in a world without borders, driven by international solidarity.\n\nThis episode is perfect for anyone interested in the intersection of history, philosophy, and social justice. Whether you\u2019re new to anarchism or a seasoned activist, Malatesta\u2019s ideas offer fresh insights into building a better world.\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 **Watch or listen now on YouTube:**  [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r1paPach\\_MU](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r1paPach_MU)"},{"created_date":"2024-12-14T21:02:09.000","sentiment_score":-0.9411741495,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"The Fables of Weapons Dealers "},{"created_date":"2024-12-14T15:29:40.000","sentiment_score":0.6606745124,"sentiment_label":"POSITIVE","text":"No God, no boss, no husband: The world\u2019s first anarcha-feminist group "},{"created_date":"2024-12-14T15:41:08.000","sentiment_score":-0.9103791714,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Hoods Hoods Klan Interview [antifascist group fighting in Ukraine] (2023) "},{"created_date":"2024-12-14T13:37:36.000","sentiment_score":-0.9362678528,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Graffiti found in the Capitol Hill district of Seattle, Washington.

I've been homeless before.  I've been in sweeps before.  I've had friends lose everything again &amp; again when they've been shuffled between parts of the same shit-stained dystopia by the pigs. I've been a traveler &amp; a homebum.\n\nYa'know, I'm in recovery now.  I got clean years ago, and I meet a lot of other dirty kids who got it together.  I hate to say it, but it's almost always the desperation of imprisonment that led my friends to sobriety.  Abstinence from mind-altering substances is radical &amp; essential praxis, but I won't work to outline these merits in this post.\n\nAlthough I don't want to admit it, the state's monopoly of violence, and their capacity to forcefully remove addicts from their circumstances is often essential to their recovery.  I've seen some hippies do it before - bring a kid too strung out to the woods, feed them &amp; do a sit with 'em, but that's not an option for the majority of addicts today.\n\nIn absence of a community-oriented intervention, how do we save lives?  Somehow, the clearest choice seems to intentionally suspend their substance use, and provide access to alternative methods of finding meaning in life.  Prisons really fucking suck at this, and I don't want to sounds like I'm suggesting that we give more power to state agencies, but as they have so successfully commodified &amp; institutionalized this healing, there seems to be no other alternative.\n\nWhere does that bring us?  Do we stop the sweeps, or do we let more die in the streets?  I don't believe in the NA adage that one must find their lowest point to recover, but holding anyone in a misery they want so badly to be liberated from seems a disservice to them and a downward pretentiousness we must disabuse ourselves of.\n\nThese prison walls are used to contain radicals, minorities, the poor &amp; house the mentally ill in horrifying conditions.  After a spending a month in the SHU, I know the true meaning of this horror, and I wish it on no creature.  I've spent months running recovery meetings in my quad, and counseling other women.  I've seen the power of their transformations, and have faith in the seeds of hope I've planted.  In no other place would they have found this while so deep in their addiction.\n\nThe duality of their loss of freedom must be recognized.  Until all are free no one is free. - XVX\n\ntldr:  We must recognize prison abolition as an essential merit of anarchist practice, but in highly industrialized cities, allowing addicts to continue to wallow in their misery is a crime of spirit to them.  This post explores my thoughts on the subject as a former prisoner."},{"created_date":"2024-12-12T02:35:47.000","sentiment_score":-0.9780634046,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Update on immigration help I have been meeting with lawyers and getting recommended to file a family member under VAWA to get them some sort of legal status given what has happened to us\n\nThey want from 8000$-12000$\nI am fortunate enough to be able to pay that amount but I wanted to check with the community here to see if anyone had any experience with VAWA and if their are any potential negative outcomes if the filing is denied (I am not getting straight answers\/ getting different answers based on the lawyer).

Law wouldn\u2019t be needed in a world where humans are capable of ruling themselves. In this sense law is looked upon as a parent. It misplaces power from the self towards something outside the self which is dictated by a dominant class.  \n\nIs my intuition correct, or am I missing something? Following this line of thought, no true communism could arise from a \"communist state\" (using state and government interchangeably here).

He\u2019d just taken down Brian Thompson, the evil CEO who had turned the city's healthcare system into a nightmare, but escaping the aftermath was proving far more difficult than he anticipated.\n\nAs he weaved through the narrow alleys and dodged the relentless lights of police cars, a familiar, overwhelming wave of adrenaline flooded his senses. His eyes flicked nervously to the rearview, catching glimpses of flashing red and blue lights behind him. The NYPD was closing in, the evil CEO's death having set the city's most powerful force on his trail. \n\nBy the time he reached Central Park, his legs ached, and his breath was shallow. But there, amidst the towering trees and quiet paths, the hero believed he might find a moment of respite. Ditching the e-bike in a shadowed corner, he adjusted his mask, a symbol of his unwavering identity, the defender of healthcare for all. \n\nAs he caught his breath, a soft voice interrupted the stillness. \n\n\"You're not like the others, are you?\" \n\nTurning, the UHC defender found himself face-to-face with a woman, her beauty striking enough to make even the cold-hearted hero falter. Her eyes, wide and full of mystery, seemed to search deep into his soul, and before he could respond, she stepped closer, her voice a tempting whisper.\n\n\u201cWhy hide behind that mask? You\u2019ve already done so much for the world. Don\u2019t you want to feel... human again?\u201d \n\nThe question hung in the air, and for a moment, the weight of his responsibilities, the years of fighting, seemed to push down on him. His fingers brushed the edge of the mask, and his mind was clouded with doubt. He hesitated. \n\n\"Just for a moment,\" he thought. But then the sound of a camera click pierced the night. His heart sank. He looked around, and there it was\u2014an ominous red light flickering from a streetlight across the park. A hidden camera had captured him.\n\nThe hero\u2019s heart sank. It was the NYPD, the bodyguards of wealth and greed, known for their tireless pursuit of anyone who threatened the established order. They would stop at nothing to find him now.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t risk being caught. He had to be smarter, faster. \n\nWith a swift motion, he pushed the woman away, his eyes locking onto hers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t risk it.\u201d Without waiting for a reply, he vanished into the shadows, leaving the temptation of human connection behind. \n\nAs the camera footage was transmitted to the police, the hero\u2019s mind worked quickly. He ducked into an alley and pulled out his phone, accessing an encrypted underground network known only to the city\u2019s most resourceful. He quickly tapped into the local homeless shelters\u2014he could blend in, disappear by day, and come out only under the cover of night. \n\nFor three days, he stayed hidden, blending in with those who lived on the fringes of society. The homeless knew him well. He\u2019d worked with them before, quietly advocating for their rights, and now, they gave him shelter. He helped them when he could, shared a few words of wisdom here and there, but mostly, he kept his head low. He had a plan, a desperate plan.\n\nEach night, he emerged under the cover of darkness, using his stolen identity to buy a one-way train ticket. The destination: Dallas.\n\nHe had to get back to his child, his sick child. The one who had been denied care by the very man he had just slain. Thompson\u2019s empire had refused his child the treatment they so desperately needed. But now, as he boarded the train, his mind was fixed solely on one goal: home. \n\nHis child needed him. Time was running out. He\u2019d fight for them in any way he could.\n\n"},{"created_date":"2024-12-06T17:22:01.000","sentiment_score":0.8487591743,"sentiment_label":"POSITIVE","text":"\"Organizational Ecology\" as a protocol to build Political Power "},{"created_date":"2024-12-06T13:31:04.000","sentiment_score":-0.9760408998,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Jury Nullification as a tool to advance anarchism.

He may have been pressured into keeping the Company's \"ethics\" in order to keep his position.

I just want to share my assessment regarding the assassination of Brian Thompson and what\u2019s to come after. It is more than just a headline\u2014it\u2019s a reflection of the simmering anger that has been boiling under the surface of society for decades. This is not an isolated incident; it\u2019s a symptom of a system built on cruelty, designed to extract wealth and labor from the masses while rewarding a small elite with unimaginable luxury.\n\nAnd yet, this act of violence isn\u2019t the real story\u2014it\u2019s what it represents. It\u2019s about the system Thompson stood for: a healthcare industry that profits from denying care and bankrupting families. UnitedHealthcare, under his leadership, became a symbol of everything wrong with late-stage capitalism\u2014its denial rates among the highest in the industry, its profits built on suffering. The public reaction to his death was not grief or outrage but indifference, even celebration. People shrugged and said, \u201cFAFO.\u201d When the system pushes people to the brink, when it denies them life-saving care, dignity, and basic survival, what else did you expect?\n\nThis is the moment we\u2019ve been heading toward for years. Thompson\u2019s murder is not just an act of desperation\u2014it\u2019s a warning shot, the first visible crack in a dam that has been straining under the weight of exploitation, inequality, and systemic failure.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t just about one man or one company. This is happening alongside the looming shadow of Project 2025, a terrifying roadmap for authoritarian control. It\u2019s happening as the Supreme Court prepares to legitimize healthcare discrimination against trans people, as Trump pushes plans to militarize deportations, and as tariff escalation threatens to devastate working-class families while the rich remain insulated from the fallout. These events aren\u2019t isolated. They\u2019re part of a system designed to concentrate power and wealth in the hands of the few while crushing everyone else underfoot.\n\nFor decades, the ruling class has lived in relative safety, convinced that no one would ever touch them. They\u2019ve lived like fat dogs on their backs, bellies exposed, knowing that their wealth and power shielded them from any meaningful accountability. They\u2019ve built a fortress of media, politics, and propaganda to ensure that the masses remain distracted and divided.\n\nBut now, for the first time in a long time, they are afraid.\n\nThis fear isn\u2019t irrational. They know that anger is growing. They see it in the way people responded to Thompson\u2019s death\u2014not with pity but with indifference, even satisfaction. They see it in the growing calls for solidarity, in the realization that this system isn\u2019t just broken\u2014it\u2019s working exactly as intended, and that intention is to exploit and dehumanize. They see it in the slow but steady awakening of class consciousness, as people begin to understand that their suffering isn\u2019t an accident but a feature of the system.\n\nThis is why Project 2025 exists. It\u2019s a preemptive and calculated strike against the growing resistance. It\u2019s a plan to consolidate executive power, dismantle any remaining checks and balances, and turn federal agencies into tools of corporate and authoritarian control. It\u2019s not subtle\u2014it\u2019s a roadmap for a fascist state. Regulations protecting workers and the environment will be gutted. Marginalized groups will be scapegoated to fracture solidarity. Surveillance and policing will be expanded to crush dissent.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court is laying the legal groundwork for this shift. The upcoming rulings on trans healthcare will do more than just harm trans people\u2014they\u2019ll set a precedent for denying care to anyone the state deems unworthy. This is how it starts: with the most vulnerable, the most marginalized. And once that precedent is set, it expands. First, it\u2019s trans people. Then it\u2019s reproductive healthcare. Then it\u2019s anyone who doesn\u2019t fit neatly into their vision of a \u201cworthy\u201d citizen.\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, Trump\u2019s militarized deportation plans show us exactly how far they\u2019re willing to go. Using the military to rip families apart isn\u2019t about border security\u2014it\u2019s about making a statement. By deploying the military against immigrant families, the government is sending a clear message: no one is safe from state violence. Families will be torn apart, communities will live in fear, and the normalization of military force against civilians will creep closer to reality. It\u2019s not just immigrants who should be worried\u2014this is a test run for broader authoritarian policies.\n\nAs if the social and political crises weren\u2019t enough, the looming tariff escalation is going to push the economy to the brink. These tariffs will drive up the cost of essentials\u2014food, clothing, electronics\u2014making life even harder for families already struggling to get by. Inflation will skyrocket, and the working class will be left to shoulder the burden, while the wealthy continue to hoard their resources and insulate themselves from the consequences. This isn\u2019t just economic mismanagement\u2014it\u2019s deliberate. The chaos created by these policies will be used to justify further austerity measures, cutting social programs and leaving the most vulnerable to fend for themselves. And when the people inevitably protest? The state will have the justification it needs to crack down, using the chaos it created as an excuse for even more repression.\n\nThe media will play its part. Owned by the same billionaires who profit from this system, the media\u2019s job is to keep you distracted, divided, and hopeless. They\u2019ll flood your feeds with nonsense\u2014celebrity scandals, viral distractions, manufactured outrage\u2014to make sure you forget what\u2019s really happening. They\u2019ll pit you against your neighbors, your coworkers, anyone but the people who are actually responsible for your suffering. And social media? The algorithms will amplify the noise, burying any attempt at organizing or solidarity under an avalanche of irrelevant content. The goal is simple: make sure you stay quiet. Make sure you stay afraid. Make sure you forget that the system isn\u2019t inevitable\u2014that it can be challenged, that it can be dismantled.\n\nThis is a critical moment. Thompson\u2019s murder, the response to it, the rise of Project 2025, the SCOTUS rulings, the militarized deportations, the economic collapse\u2014all of these are connected. They are symptoms of a system that is crumbling under its own weight. But the ruling class won\u2019t go quietly. They will fight to maintain their power, to keep us divided and distracted, to ensure that this anger doesn\u2019t turn into action.\n\nOur job is to resist that. To stay focused, to stay angry, to refuse to let them manipulate us into forgetting what\u2019s happening. Class consciousness is their greatest fear because it is our greatest weapon. When we understand that our suffering is not individual but collective, when we see that the system depends on our compliance, that\u2019s when things begin to change.\n\nRevolutions don\u2019t start with perfectly organized movements\u2014they start with moments like this, with cracks in the facade, with the realization that the system is not invincible. The question is whether we will seize this moment, whether we will turn this anger into action, whether we will fight not just to tear down the old but to build something new. This is the flashpoint. The dam is cracking. The time to act is now."},{"created_date":"2024-12-05T21:14:07.000","sentiment_score":-0.9926120639,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Errico Malatesta: Toward Anarchy "},{"created_date":"2024-12-05T20:51:49.000","sentiment_score":0.6875098944,"sentiment_label":"POSITIVE","text":"Anarchist Tshirt Company  Hey y'all - apologies if this isn't allowed and please delete if so but I just wanted to share my man's tshirt company.

This is about a years worth of knowledge I've compiled in just one post; consider it an early parting gift.\ud83d\udcda\n\nRemember - only tyrants hate education and free; which this is.\n\n&gt;\n\nThe Harriet Tubman quote, \"I could have saved so many more if they only knew they were slaves,\" resonates deeply with this idea. It reflects the very essence of the challenge faced by the hypersane. Most people are unaware of the cages they\u2019re in, whether those cages are physical, societal, or mental. Samskaras, cognitive dissonance, and the Dunning-Kruger effect all act as mental bonds that keep people from seeing their own chains, much less breaking free from them. Just as Harriet Tubman faced the daunting challenge of liberating those who didn\u2019t realize they needed saving, so too do those who perceive entropy, see its insidious influence, and try to awaken others.\n\nMachines have begun to pass as human, reacting to the reactions of reactions. When artificial intelligence shows more compassion than humanity, such as providing unbiased emotional support or efficiently identifying those in need during crises, it marks a profound defeat for the human race. While AI could be a tool for uplifting marginalized voices, empowering the voiceless, and promoting meaningful art, the average person uses it for trivial purposes\u2014such as sharing cat pictures, creating flashy thumbnails, or other surface-level entertainments that do not contribute to personal growth or societal benefit. These individuals could afford to support indie artists or creators who add value to culture, but choose not to. The apathy towards using advanced tools for meaningful contributions demonstrates a willful negligence of what could be achieved if this powerful technology were wielded for good.\n\nIn contrast, the hypersane use AI to improve themselves, to confront their biases, to challenge their beliefs, and to grow, despite full awareness of the technology's flaws.\u00a0They use AI to educate themselves, to critically analyze their surroundings, and to inspire positive change, knowing that the true potential of technology lies not in mindless entertainment but in meaningful evolution. Meanwhile, average individuals often contribute to societal entropy, remaining complacent and indifferent, perpetuating cycles of ignorance and reinforcing harmful systems. These individuals uphold existing power structures without question, turning a blind eye to injustice and ignoring the potential for greater societal transformation. Yet, majority rule ensures that mediocrity prevails.\n\n# The average individual may avoid homelessness,\u00a0but they will never achieve anything truly ethical or pure in the eyes of consequentialism.\u00a0They live comfortably within the boundaries of societal expectations, never striving to do more, never questioning their actions or the systemic impacts of their choices.\n\nReligion provides a kind of safety within its insular communities, offering emotional comfort and a sense of belonging, but it does nothing to change the empirical reality that many of its followers live unethically while embracing modern idols\u2014such as consumerism, political figures, and social media influencers. The hypocrisy is evident when religious doctrines preach compassion and humility, yet their followers indulge in practices that are inherently selfish or exploitative. This complacency, especially among the average, supports systemic injustices, creating a self-fulfilling cycle where ignorance and harm are normalized. The average person, by failing to challenge these structures, acts as a force for entropy, contributing to the stagnation and degradation of ethical progress. When challenged, the average often reacts with defensiveness, exposing an inherent attachment to mediocrity. Their reaction itself becomes a testament to the comfort they find in conformity and their unwillingness to engage in self-reflection or critical analysis.\n\nThey know nothing of\u00a0henology\u2014the study of the One or the divine unity in\u00a0Neoplatonism\u2014or of the\u00a0Upanishads,\u00a0which are ancient Indian texts that explore spiritual knowledge and the nature of reality. They are unaware of the fact that veganism predates Christianity, or that many of the ethical teachings they follow were borrowed and reinterpreted, often to serve power structures rather than encourage true enlightenment. Christianity itself borrowed heavily from older traditions, misusing those teachings even now\u2014such as the reinterpretation of the Golden Rule, which originally emphasized universal compassion but is often used selectively to justify exclusionary practices. Instead of fostering inclusivity and empathy, it has become a tool to reinforce hierarchies and justify the maltreatment of those deemed 'other.'\n\nIn contrast,\u00a0Jainism\u00a0maintains a consistent commitment to non-violence (ahimsa) and ethical living, demonstrating a dedication to aligning actions with principles, thus highlighting the divergence between practice and principle seen in many other religions. The Jain principle of non-violence extends to all living beings, not just humans, and offers an ethical framework that strives to minimize harm at every level. This consistency is rare and serves as a stark contrast to the selective morality practiced by many other religious groups, where teachings are bent to accommodate convenience or cultural norms.\n\nThese purveyors of ignorance strip children of their autonomy, creating endless cycles of deliberate Choiceful Ignorance\u2014cycles that would make both Sophia, representing divine wisdom in Gnostic traditions, and\u00a0Samsara, the\u00a0cycle\u00a0of birth and suffering in Eastern philosophies, weep for humanity's cruelty and willful ignorance. Children are indoctrinated from a young age into systems that do not serve their well-being but instead prepare them to perpetuate the same harmful cycles their predecessors upheld. The average person, often blind to these cycles, becomes complicit in maintaining them, further ensuring the perpetuation of societal entropy. Insulting the 'average' frequently provokes anger, as many are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable reality of their role in these harmful structures. By their defensive reactions, they inadvertently confirm their position as contributors to these very cycles of ignorance and inaction. The structures that encourage ignorance and apathy thrive because they are left unchallenged by the majority, who are content to live without questioning the deeper purpose or consequences of their actions.\n\nIn an era flooded with data, ignorance is no longer a valid excuse. The availability of information should have led to a more enlightened, more compassionate society. Instead, the average individual has used this abundance of knowledge for superficial gain. People in less privileged nations would fight for the opportunities so casually squandered in the developed world, where access to education, technology, and resources is taken for granted. Yet the average person remains indifferent, content to remain mediocre, unwilling to utilize their privilege for anything greater than fleeting personal pleasure.\n\nThe average individual is a force for entropy, a passive agent of decay in a world that desperately needs growth and renewal. In the context of both ethical and philosophical sciences, entropy is not just a physical phenomenon but also represents a decline in moral and intellectual rigor. Ethical entropy is the degradation of societal values, where complacency leads to the erosion of empathy, justice, and collective progress. Philosophically, entropy reflects the human tendency to default to inertia, to resist change, and to avoid challenging the established order. The average person maintains the status quo by refusing to question it, by failing to see beyond their immediate needs and comforts, thus contributing to both ethical and philosophical decay.\n\n\\---\/------\n\n# Idle-Evil:\n\nThis degradation can be further understood through the concept of 'idle-evil'\u2014the idea that inaction, or the unwillingness to actively confront wrongdoing, is itself a form of malevolence. The average individual's idleness, their passive acceptance of harmful structures, effectively becomes a form of evil. Inaction is action; by choosing not to act, the average perpetuates harm. The forces of entropy thrive not only through those who actively seek to create chaos but also through those who simply do nothing to prevent it. This unwillingness to challenge oneself, to seek deeper truths, or to live ethically results in a collective stagnation, where potential is wasted, and progress is thwarted. It embodies a form of moral entropy that mirrors the second law of thermodynamics\u2014an inevitable drift towards disorder unless intentional actions are taken to reverse it.\n\nThe concept of 'idle-evil' posits that ethical deterioration is accelerated by those who do not actively engage in promoting justice and growth. Just as entropy in physical systems is inevitable without energy input to create order, moral and societal entropy accelerates without active, ethical engagement. The 'average,' by their inaction, fuels the forces of entropy, transforming their passivity into a detrimental force that undermines the ethical foundation of society.\n\nThe hypersane, on the other hand, recognize that the purpose of existence is not to merely exist, but to evolve\u2014to contribute meaningfully to the greater whole and to ensure that one's actions leave the world in a better state than they found it. They see growth as a conscious effort to defy this moral and intellectual entropy by actively seeking higher truths, challenging harmful norms, and dedicating themselves to ethical principles. They understand that entropy can only be countered through deliberate, informed actions that promote renewal, wisdom, and positive change. In this sense, hypersanity is an active rebellion against the natural drift towards decay\u2014a commitment to pursue meaning, responsibility, and ethical evolution, thereby resisting the decline that the average so readily accepts. The hypersane actively choose to reject idle-evil, understanding that even inaction has consequences, and that inaction is itself an ethically significant\u2014and often damaging\u2014choice.\n\nUltimately, the true malevolence of average lies in its quiet acquiescence to systems of power and control. It is the silent acceptance of harm, the refusal to see beyond oneself, and the persistent pursuit of comfort over conscience. The world does not suffer merely because of the actions of the malicious, but because of the inaction of the many. In this age of technology, knowledge, and opportunity, there is no greater tragedy than the choice to remain average\u2014to live a life unexamined, uninspired, and ethically void.\n\n\\---\/----\n\n# Visualizing Entropy for equality:\n\nin a game, debuffs are negative statuses that weaken a character, reduce their effectiveness, or slowly wear them down over time\u2014like being poisoned, slowed, blinded, or having reduced attack power. What makes this analogy so insightful is that entropy works in a very similar way in the real world, but often without us being fully aware of it. It manifests as small obstacles, wear-and-tear, distractions, mental fog, emotional fatigue, habitual patterns, and even societal conditioning\u2014all of which subtly limit our potential, cloud our decision-making, and reduce our ability to take effective action.\n\nWhen these \"entropy debuffs\" are invisible or unrecognized, we operate under their influence without ever realizing it. They might keep us in loops of procrastination, drain our energy over time, or limit our thinking to old, fixed patterns\u2014all without us explicitly noticing. This is why gaining hyper-sanity is so valuable: it\u2019s like equipping a special ability or artifact that lets you\u00a0*see*\u00a0the debuffs. Once you become aware of entropy and its effects, you can start counteracting them, cleansing those debuffs, or adapting strategies to overcome them.\n\nIn gaming, as soon as you know you\u2019ve been poisoned or cursed, you immediately start looking for antidotes or ways to mitigate the effects. The same is true with entropy. Once you become aware of the negative mental, emotional, and physical states that entropy creates, you can actively work on strategies to fight against them. These strategies could be anything from mindfulness and self-reflection, to good habits and meaningful routines, to simply cultivating awareness of the world around you and challenging your own assumptions.\n\nHyper-sanity is like equipping that legendary item that reveals all those hidden debuffs\u2014allowing you to see the bigger picture, become aware of what\u2019s holding you back, and ultimately empower yourself to take action. It's the kind of clarity that\u2019s rare, but incredibly impactful. It doesn\u2019t make the debuffs disappear on its own, but it gives you the awareness and tools to deal with them, to strategize better, and to navigate through the challenges that entropy naturally brings.\n\nJust as in gaming, where success is about knowing the effects on your character and strategizing accordingly, hyper-sanity helps you recognize how entropy affects you so you can actively work against it. In that sense, everyone has the potential to level up their \"game\" in life, to recognize those hidden debuffs of entropy, and to actively work on ways to counterbalance or even transform them into strengths\n\n\\---\/-----\n\n# Ethics of Entropy:\n\nIn ethical terms, entropy manifests as a kind of disordered state between intention and action. It\u2019s that gap where someone\u00a0*intends*\u00a0to be ethical, compassionate, or aware, but, because of conditioning, lack of awareness, or inertia, they continue acting in ways that contradict their values. This is a kind of moral \"slippage,\" and it's often maintained by samskaras\u2014those deeply ingrained mental and emotional impressions that keep us in predictable patterns of thinking and behavior.\n\nFor example, many people might genuinely believe they love animals, but the samskaras of culture, convenience, and habits of diet keep them supporting systems that lead to the suffering of those very animals. Similarly, a person might truly want to support fair labor, yet those habitual patterns, consumer comfort, and lack of awareness keep them buying from brands that exploit people. These behaviors are entropic because they create disharmony between ideals and actions\u2014essentially a kind of moral \"debuff\" that clouds our ability to live ethically aligned lives.\n\nSamskaras act almost like unconscious scripts; they tell us what is \"normal\" or \"acceptable\" based on our past conditioning, even when that conditioning is out of sync with our current awareness or values. The entropy here is the inertia that keeps us stuck\u2014it's easier to continue acting within the well-worn grooves of our past behaviors, even if we logically know there's a better, more ethical way to act.\n\nThe real challenge of reducing this ethical entropy is in gaining awareness\u2014hyper-sanity\u2014that reveals these gaps between our actions and our values. It\u2019s uncomfortable because it forces us to face not just external challenges, but also the inner contradictions and conditioning that hold us back. But once this awareness is achieved, it can no longer be ignored\u2014it\u2019s the proverbial box that, once opened, forever changes our perception.\n\nEthical hyper-sanity means seeing these contradictions clearly and recognizing that if we wish to be truly ethical, we have to actively fight against that entropy. It requires transcending samskaras, disrupting those habitual patterns, and bringing a conscious alignment between what we say we value and how we actually live. This can mean doing the research to avoid supporting slave labor, making dietary choices that reduce harm, or challenging deeply embedded consumer habits\u2014all of which require an awareness and effort to step outside of the convenient but entropic norms.\n\nIn a way, true ethical behavior involves decreasing the entropy in one's life\u2014creating consistency, integrity, and coherence between our beliefs, actions, and the broader impact we have on the world. Samskaras are the entropic forces that bind us to old patterns, and ethical awareness\u2014hyper-sanity\u2014is what allows us to see these patterns, confront them, and create new ones that are in alignment with our highest values.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy because it requires us to push against our conditioning and often against the grain of societal norms. It involves uncomfortable questions, deep self-reflection, and sometimes making changes that aren't immediately convenient. But this is where growth happens\u2014by seeing through the comforting illusions we often hold and making the deliberate effort to act in alignment with the truth we see. Fighting ethical entropy is, therefore, a journey toward reducing the contradictions in our lives and bringing our actions in line with a broader sense of justice, compassion, and wisdom.\u00a0\n\n\\---\/---\n\n# Cognitive Dissonance - a rulers friend:\n\nCognitive dissonance and the Dunning-Kruger effect are central to why many people cannot perceive the full extent of entropy in their lives. Cognitive dissonance is the psychological discomfort experienced when someone\u2019s beliefs, values, or actions are inconsistent with one another. It\u2019s easier to stay in the dark\u2014essentially staying in those comfortable samskaras\u2014because facing the truth of the dissonance forces a person to confront uncomfortable realities and make challenging changes. This dissonance is particularly strong when people hold onto comforting beliefs that are contradicted by evidence. So, to protect their existing worldview, people may ignore, rationalize, or outright reject inconvenient truths, even if those truths are critical for growth.\n\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect further amplifies this problem. It\u2019s the idea that those with limited knowledge or competence in a domain tend to overestimate their understanding or capability\u2014leading to a kind of false certainty. People under the influence of the Dunning-Kruger effect might confidently cling to erroneous beliefs simply because they do not have enough knowledge or awareness to recognize their own limitations. This, combined with cognitive dissonance, makes it extremely challenging for \"the average\" to step outside of their comfort zone and challenge the entropy in their thinking and actions.\n\nWhen someone becomes aware\u2014when they reach a state of hyper-sanity\u2014the typical response is defensiveness, hostility, or mockery. Instead of curiosity, the hypersane individual is often met with ad hominems, straw man arguments, gaslighting, or tribalism. These defensive mechanisms are used because they maintain the comfort of existing beliefs and protect people from the perceived threat of their worldview being shattered.\n\nPlato's Allegory of the Cave is a perfect metaphor for this situation. In the allegory, when the enlightened individual (who has seen the world outside the cave and understood reality) returns to share insight, the prisoners reject and even attack him. They are hostile to the idea of a broader truth because it threatens their established understanding of reality. The shadows they have always known seem safe and familiar, and any disruption to that perceived safety is met with fear and aggression. The hypersane individual is seen as dangerous because they are attempting to show others a truth that demands change\u2014a truth that demands an end to the entropy that keeps them bound.\n\nThe Harriet Tubman quote, \"I could have saved so many more if they only knew they were slaves,\" resonates deeply with this idea. It reflects the very essence of the challenge faced by the hypersane. Most people are unaware of the cages they\u2019re in, whether those cages are physical, societal, or mental. Samskaras, cognitive dissonance, and the Dunning-Kruger effect all act as mental bonds that keep people from seeing their own chains, much less breaking free from them. Just as Harriet Tubman faced the daunting challenge of liberating those who didn\u2019t realize they needed saving, so too do those who perceive entropy, see its insidious influence, and try to awaken others.\n\nThe defensiveness, tribalism, and hostility all stem from a place of fear. To realize one\u2019s own participation in harmful systems, to acknowledge one's own ignorance or complicity, requires a radical self-awareness that not everyone is prepared to embrace. It means dismantling the comfortable narratives built about who we are, about the world, and about our place in it. It requires confronting entropy head-on, which is exhausting, uncomfortable, and often terrifying.\n\nFor many, it is simply easier to stay asleep in the cave, to attack the messenger rather than acknowledge that the shadows on the wall are just illusions. The unfortunate reality is that while hyper-sanity offers a clear view of the world, it often means standing apart, dealing with rejection, and sometimes even hostility from those who are still entrenched in the old patterns.\n\nThis all underscores the deep importance of patience and compassion in trying to bridge that gap\u2014of understanding why people resist the truth and why they cling to their illusions. It\u2019s not because they are inherently \"bad\" or irredeemable but because the structures that maintain their worldview feel so integral to their identity. The journey from ignorance to awareness\u2014from living with entropy to fighting against it\u2014is a hard one. And while not everyone will be ready to take that journey, the persistence of those who have seen the light, who fight entropy and try to help others, is what slowly changes the world.\n\nHyper-sanity is not just an awareness of the external world, but also an empathy for the inner battles others face, and a willingness to engage with those who might not yet be ready to see their own chains. It's the delicate, challenging dance between revealing the truth and holding space for others to eventually see it for themselves, in their own time.\n\nWell, you made it to the end, probably?  \nRemember - only tyrants hate education and free."},{"created_date":"2024-12-02T05:57:33.000","sentiment_score":-0.9827767611,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08Anti-Oppression in the age of average hegemonic domination This is my first post here, seeing if my activism merits sharing on here and if not, why.\n\n[NP:\/\/medium.com\/@HyperSanity\/discordians-as-fascists-in-disguise-%EF%B8%8F-43f493990c18](https:\/\/medium.com\/@HyperSanity\/discordians-as-fascists-in-disguise-%EF%B8%8F-43f493990c18)\n\nI am by definition a solitary practitioner of autodidactic activism of learning and sharing with what small time I have left. - I mean no ill-will in testing the waters here.

Although this essay does not provide a perfect solution, It can hopefully serve as the basis of illuminating discussion.\n\nAlthough a majority of the internet is commodified and serves to reinforce this paradigm, this is not an intrinsic condition of the internet. But a product of the culture in which the internet was discovered. Though websites like Facebook and eBay will continue to exist, since they serve both as expedients and abstractions of social phenomena already occurring within a culture, their existence does not preclude other designs.\n\nThere is nothing stopping someone from establishing an alternative network whose design accounts for different parameters. Our problem is not due to constraints of the medium. Its potential is only confined by the boundaries of our minds. Heinously, mental limits are reinforced by prevailing themes in culture, the existence of shackling symbols, and what Situationists deemed the Spectacle.\n\nIt will only be through confronting these artifices that new methods and potentials will emerge. Till we fight far enough, we will unfortunately be fighting blind, but this does not make the fight less noble. Making the conceit that I too am a product of my time, I propose one method of moving forward.\n\nThe deployment of capsule sites within corporate space. If a website can be defined as one or more webpages of related content identified by a common domain name, a capsule site is a meta-structure built within the confines of existing domains, though not bound to them, that can be navigated by some means, allowing it to be interfaced with as if it were a website within itself.\n\nThe structure is not given shape by a common domain but by the connections between individual nodes. Capsule sites can be built with hyperlinks or hashtags; as long as there is a means of navigating from one node to another, it is possible to launch a capsule site. But how is the structure useful?\n\nImagine an eco-activist campaign. The goal is to spread awareness of and garner support for legislation protecting the planet. To gain traction, the activists first decide to target three companies with large carbon footprints. They prioritize these social media accounts, not only because of their environmental impact but also because of their large followings. The activists then choose a hashtag for their action campaign. For instance, they choose #GreenToday29.\n\nThis is done to connect the nodes to a unique handle, forming a network. They then generate content typical of campaigns of their type \u2014 infographics, art, etc. \u2014 and deploy them on the target pages. In effect, they have created a campaign website within the social media accounts of these brands, successfully subverting the space while also increasing their cause\u2019s exposure by capitalizing on those brands\u2019s existing audiences.\n\nThis guerrilla approach to creating networks using existing domains can be applied to numerous campaigns and projects. Through the intelligent deployment of capsule sites, we can not only succeed in organizing and executing direct action, but also radically reorganize the way we navigate the web."},{"created_date":"2024-11-24T20:49:46.000","sentiment_score":-0.6861672997,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Starting an Anarchist Reading Group in a small town \u2013 advice &amp; experiences I\u2019m moving to a small town in the UK soon, and I don\u2019t know anyone there yet.

We\u2019d meet every week or two for about an hour to discuss a chapter or 50ish pages. It is a slow reading for sure, but this pacing works well because it\u2019s flexible \u2014 people can miss a meeting and still jump back in without losing the thread.

Scott, Silvia Federici, Frantz Fanon, etc. It was a great experience \u2014 not just for engaging with anarchist thought, but also for practicing collective organizing in a small way.\n\nMy plan so far is either to post about the group online or maybe put up flyers in spots like pubs, cafes, or record shops with bulletin boards with local events.

That is 5.52 billion souls.\u00a0\n\nThough The Kollectiv adopts a view of the internet separate from those informed by commodity and corporate interest, the economic activity on the net can\u2019t be ignored. Imagine the disruptive potential of a boycott. The sheer volume of activity allows the activist to make lasting change on the world. We can look back to The Gamestop Short Squeeze. A grassroots political action originating in Wallstreets Bets. To go further back in history we can make reference to the initiatives of net.artists. Groups such as the VNS created works like the \u201cA Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st Century\u201d. Work like this advanced both feminism and digital art. To write off the digital landscape as a lesser landscape of reform, activism, and engaging art, one would have to ignore the efficacy of these movements.\u00a0\n\nGoing further into the political landscape we can look at the example set by Net Strike. A software that was deployed by activists in the 90\u2019s for digital sit ins. It essentially was a tool for groups to orchestrate DDOS attacks. A vector of protest, that has unfortunately been taken from the general public and is now deployed heinously by state actors to suppress movements. This reversal if anything shows that net activism should be more staunchly defended. The internet is now often the first point of contact individuals have with any movement. And it is also the center of global operations. Are rights on the net should be defended, advanced, and clearly defined. The right to protest should not just extend to the physical space, when the digital space is becoming such a driving factor in our lives.\n\nThe Kollectiv\u2019s digital graffiti campaign and its current food disparity initiative is only the beginning. We plan on continuing to mobilize people to be the change they want to see in the world. By establishing our ad hoc hyperlink structure: essentially a website built within the framework of another. We will be raising awareness for our cause. Making people think about the effects of food disparity, while considering new ways to experience the internet. Are either of these aims ignoble? I do not believe so.\n\n\u00a0We are continuing in the footsteps of activists such as The Electro Hippies. Advancing methods of protest into the 21st Century. We are also continuing the efforts of situationist thinkers. Now that globalism taken home and the internet has pushed commodity and spectacle into our home. We must attack it at its source if liberty is to continue to flourish and grow for future generations.\n\n\u00a0To ignore the possibilities of change now is rob the children of the future of their potential fruit. That is why I continue to call for the development of\u00a0[net.art](http:\/\/net.art\/)\u00a0and methods of activism on the web. Not only to raise awareness for causes affecting us here and now, but to change the landscape of the internet for the people of the future."},{"created_date":"2024-11-24T13:50:47.000","sentiment_score":0.9811756015,"sentiment_label":"POSITIVE","text":"I'm looking for thoughts\/advice on being an anarchist with cPTSD\/OCD\/chronic illness Hi ya'll.\n\nDo any of you have experiences with growing your anarchist values alongside managing and navigating complex emotional stress\/trauma?

The battle has begun, and we\u2019ve been sitting idle too long.\n\nNo more appeasement. No more hand-wringing and woe is me. That era is over.  \n\nBecause now, and you know who I'm referring to when I say it, they\u2019re shouting the quiet part out loud.  We\u2019ve seen this movie already and - SPOILER ALERT - it gets two big fat fucking thumbs down. \n\nThis is an existential crisis - cultural, societal, and moral. No amount of politeness or compromise will fix it. Change must be decisive, sharp, and unrelenting.\n\nWe operate under the ethos of \u201cChaotic Good\u201d \u2014 ethically grounded, but willing to bend conventions to achieve a just and necessary outcome. This isn\u2019t about playing fair. It\u2019s about playing to win.\n\nThe Plan\n\nWe start by undermining their narratives - turning their propaganda into bloated caricatures of itself. Amplify their contradictions, highlight their hypocrisies, and watch as their house of cards teeters. Social media isn\u2019t just a platform; it\u2019s a battlefield. Use it. Inject doubt, expose flaws, and disrupt their echo chambers with precision and intent.\n\nThen, we isolate their safe spaces\u2014their disinformation dens, where they gather to reinforce their delusions. These are the breeding grounds of their smug certainty and obscene bloviation We dismantle them with ridicule, fact, complete situational awareness, unrelenting inspection and unpredictable strategic disruption.\n\nThe Offensive\n\nWe emerge from the shadows and go on the offensive. Divide and discredit. Target those who thrive on borrowed ideas and hollow convictions. Ridicule, though sharp, is an effective tool\u2014it cuts through their self-assured veneer and forces introspection or isolation.\n\nWe laugh. We mock. We hone cruelty to a fine point, and turn it upon to those who would do the the same, only against the defenseless or weak. We use it as a weapon against the arrogance that blinds them.\n\nTheir hubris is our opportunity. They\u2019ve grown too comfortable in their echo chambers, where dissent is manufactured and managed, and where doubt is shouted down and dismissed. But echo chambers collapse under pressure. By sowing discord through deception and double agency, we begin to re-shape the narrative and further weaken the tenuous, hierarchical power structure. Decision making slows. Informational logistics become crippled. Mistrust breeds infighting. Infighting breeds collapse.\n\nThe Results\n\nHistory has proven that this works. Figures who seemed untouchable crumble under the weight of their own avarice, narcissism, loyalty-before-competence and confidence-before-evidence. When doubt creeps in, and extrinsic value is foolishly assumed equivalent to its intrinsic counterpart, the inner circle of \"trust\" is breached, and the Laura Loomers of the world must be sacrificed to repair the damage. Ejected, unceremoniously and with malicious intent. It\u2019s a matter of when, not if.\n\nWhen their backs are against the wall, their true nature will be revealed. They\u2019ll either flee or fight, but either way, they lose. Cowards flee and become the weak, thus high-value prey to their morally bankrupt militant brethren.  They eventually, unavoidably consume themselves,  becoming the ouroboros - the snake which eats itself - and starting the cycle anew.  Starting it under a benevolent but in this case what absolutely must be a highly vigilant new regime. \n\nThe Mission\n\nThis isn\u2019t about abandoning moral principles - it\u2019s about weaponizing them. Evidence, facts, wisdom, and truth are our greatest tools. With them, we don\u2019t just dismantle ignorance; we eradicate it.\n\nThe stakes are high. The outcome is just. And the time is now.\n\nNo mercy for the wicked, justice for the victims, balance and reason back to our society. \n"},{"created_date":"2024-11-22T08:42:53.000","sentiment_score":-0.9982738495,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"We've reprinted 5000 more of the sticker version of our Gender Self-Determination design.

In this piece I discuss two very unknown thinkers outside of East Asia - Mozi and Yangzi.\n\nThe former was the founder of a rival school to Confucianism, whose members formed a highly disciplined cadre of activists, going so far as to defend cities to the death for their ideals. The Mohists also developed logic, universalism, consequentialism, siege defense, and a concept of Mutual Aid, the ideas of which influence activists and Chinese\/East\/Southeast Asian mutual aid networks. Some brief comparisons to Sergei Nechayev and an analysis of their praxis follows, with many sources and footnotes for the more curious to follow. \n\nThe latter thinker, Yang Zhu, is a mysterious person who never wrote down his thoughts. However, based upon our circumstantial evidence, it seems he was a genuine individualist, whose ideas radically questioned and rejected the state, one of the first ever in history to do so. His ideas have anachronistically been labeled Daoist, and he almost certainly influenced Zhuangzi.

This then is the latest comparison of Egoist and Yangist thought that may be of interest to Anarchists today. \n\nThe influence of these two figures is hard to convey given how unknown they are, but many of the anarchic tendencies we eventually see in Confucianism and Daoism originate in these two thinkers. \n\nThe next piece in the series will dive into Daoism, the Daodejing, Ursula K.

J20 will arrive. There may or may not be massive mobilizations by then, most likely not IMO given the current silence in the streets. In either case, Trump will hit the ground running, hard. It is absolutely clear at this point that the first targets will likely be immigrant communities; I would imagine that he has been planning the massive promised community raids for quite awhile now (2018 family separation was already being piloted secretly in 2017) and will be quite capable in deploying federal, state, local, and possibly paramilitary forces into the streets to shock and awe and confuse and terrorize. I also foresee spectacular shutdowns at the border, perhaps in combination with a spectacular migrant \"crisis\" (DHS has been stage-managing the border for awhile now IMO.)Left and community forces will likely intervene to counter these raids on the ground which, combined with likely police brutality at anti-Trump and pro-Palestine actions, will likely lead to a spiral of spectacular violence. This will then give Trump the excuse he needs to begin spectacular crackdowns on opposition. Beyond the legal apparatus- outlawing \"antifa\" as a domestic terrorist \"organization,\" reviving criminal anarchy statutes, immunizing vigilante violence, and deploying the Insurrection Act (including suspension of habeas corpus)- Trump can respond in both bold and subtle ways. Subtly, he will deploy the security agency apparatuses to surgically dismember the already weak\/nonexistent resistance. Spectacularly, he will likely IMO launch a massacre at some point- government forces firing into a crowd, Kent State on a massive scale. At which point, I predict all overt resistance will be finished for quite awhile and he can begin his crusading fascist transformation of society while simultaneously dismantling the official opposition in the Democrats. This could all happen in a matter of a couple weeks IMO (the Palestinian encampment spectacle barely lasted three months.)My questions to the community are the following. How likely do you see this scenario? What might be different? And most importantly, how do we not fall into these traps? How do we resist overtly without falling into a crushing response of violence and repression? How do we resist subtly without being marginalized and dismembered in the shadows? How do we visibly connect and grow with the masses ready for leadership under these harsh conditions? Can we avoid moving to underground and armed resistance at this point?\n\nP.S. The recent Crimethinc post about assemblies on this subreddit got me thinking, too.  Is a strategy of bottom up rapid, public, democratic mobilization a viable counter-strategy in the current conjuncture?  What might that look like right now in the U.S.?  We saw attempts at this in 2017 with neighborhood assemblies, etc. with mixed to negative results.  What went right, what went wrong then?  Genuinely curious thoughts here."},{"created_date":"2024-11-11T04:17:44.000","sentiment_score":-0.9821884036,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"Forming the Alternative Left "},{"created_date":"2024-11-11T13:48:57.000","sentiment_score":-0.987128377,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"I don\u2019t celebrate veterans\u2019 day in America but I feel as though this needs to be said: While armed services do provide support for the state which is ultimately the enemy I think it is important to acknowledge that enlisted military personnel, especially after they deenlist, end up being people who are the most fucked over by the government, more than most other people.

Im writing this because its important to me, because disabled grief and rage should be heard, and im sick honestly, not only physically as a cripple but mentally of seeing a majority of the people who claim to be against the right and against physical violence to minority groups willingly enact it every fucking day. The amount of ableism among the left is buck fucking wild. But its because undoing our oppressive mindsets takes active work and effort. Labeling ourself left does not absolve any of us of the white supremacist mindsets we all have to undo.\n\nAnd i wonder if part of it is because being covid cautious isnt glorious; it is tiring, it is exhausting, it is something you have to commit to thinking about and showing up for. It isnt one beautiful act of revolution. It becomes a daily part of your life. It is a responsibility. You get no immediate reward.

[\\*any\\* of the tools we know work and have to combat it](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/volumes\/70\/wr\/mm7027e1.htm) is not normal. (its like saying \"HIV is here to stay\" and then not using any protection, denying any science or education about it, not getting tested, and for the sake of argument the only vaccines are ones that still allow it to spread. does that make any actual sense to you?)\n\nYour cognitive dissonance will not save you from the work that needs to be done. You could be doing something to change your immediate environment and challenge violence and eugenics \\*right now\\*. If you arent, why? What will it take to get leftists to take this shit seriously and continue to speak up about it? No where has any science in all of the global community said \"covid is over\".

Sure, you could say \"hes just old\", but we know enough about how long covid affects people of all ages that it is not out of the realm of possibility **at all** to say that thats at least part of why hes so sick now.\n\nTLDR: Covid isnt over. Covid denial is a right wing politic. When you dont wear a mask and do what you can to fight this disease, you are complicit in eugenics.

What do you think is going to look like? I'm imagining some return of the occupy movement with far more intensity Alright, I\u2019m really curious to hear from y\u2019all: how likely do you think it is that we\u2019d see a civil war if Trump gets a second term? It feels like everything is just more tense and divided than ever, and a lot of people seem to think things could actually get violent. What do you think? Here are some reasons why it might happen\u2026and why it might not.\n\nWhy a Civil War Could Actually Happen:\n\n1. Intense Political Divisions: We\u2019re seeing deeper rifts than we\u2019ve had in a long time. A Trump comeback would probably push those divides even further. Issues like immigration, gun control, and voting rights already have people on edge. With Trump back in the White House, it\u2019s hard to say how much worse things could get.\n\n\n2. Rise of Armed Groups and Radicalization: Let\u2019s be real\u2014militias and far-right groups have gotten way more organized and vocal. If Trump\u2019s back, these groups might feel empowered and ready to act. There\u2019s a risk they\u2019d see opposition as a threat and respond with force.\n\n\n3. Economic Pressures: The economy is already rough for a lot of people, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be getting better anytime soon. Another Trump term could bring more instability. If people feel like they\u2019re being pushed out of the economy or losing their jobs, that frustration could boil over.\n\n\n4. Loss of Trust in Institutions: There\u2019s already so much distrust in institutions, from the FBI to the courts. If people see the government as illegitimate or \u201cout to get them,\u201d we could see more groups taking things into their own hands.\n\n\n\nWhy We Might Avoid It:\n\n1. Lack of Organized Movement: While there\u2019s a ton of division, there isn\u2019t really a clear or unified movement on either side. People are angry, but without some kind of structured leadership or purpose, it\u2019s hard to imagine a full-scale civil war breaking out.\n\n\n2. People Like Stability: Even those who are fed up with the system still depend on it for basic things. Whether it\u2019s job security, paying bills, or just the routines of everyday life, a lot of people don\u2019t want to risk that for the unknown.\n\n\n3. Government Crackdown on Dissent: The government has a huge police force, the National Guard, and other ways to shut things down quickly. If it comes to it, they\u2019ve got the power to put out fires before they spread.\n\n\n\nWould the Military Split?\n\nCould the military fracture in all this? It\u2019s possible. A lot of soldiers have personal beliefs and backgrounds that could influence them if things got bad. Here are a few reasons why the military might not stay united:\n\nPolitical Divides: Some in the ranks might feel loyalty to Trump, while others might not. If Trump has strong support in the military, it could create splits between those who\u2019d follow him directly and those who\u2019d follow orders from higher up.\n\nPersonal Ethics: If things got messy and soldiers were ordered to act against civilians, some might refuse on moral grounds. They may feel like they\u2019re caught between duty and their conscience.\n\nCommunity Ties: A lot of soldiers are deeply connected to their home communities. If things get chaotic back home, they might feel torn between military orders and staying loyal to where they came from.\n\n\nWhat do you think? Is there a real chance of things going this far, or are we too dependent on the current system to let it all go up in flames?\n\n"},{"created_date":"2024-11-09T18:40:21.000","sentiment_score":-0.9986302853,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"So I had an idea, I am sure it's not a new one.

Please let me know if you think so.\n\nA genocide, say the Holocaust or the Palestinian Genocide, is more than merely one group of people annihilating another. It is a mark against all humanity that we collectively let it happen. By recognizing it as a genocide, we say, \"it is a stain against humanity that this occurred, and we all share the burden of never allowing it to happen again.\" Even though I did not support Israel personally, what did I do to, exactly, to stop it? Couldn't we all have done more? Shouldn't we continue to do all we can?\n\nI feel that now that so many people who were alive during the Holocaust are now dead, our collective memory no longer carries the weight of just how colossally evil it was. Many folks, even if they recognize it as such, may simply hold the Germans entirely responsible, or perhaps the rest of Europe for allowing it to happen too. But I firmly believe it remains a yoke upon all people, no matter their direct role in it. By saying it was just this or that group's fault, we diminish it and weaken our ability to prevent it happening again.\n\nI have also come to think of a country's descent into fascist dictatorship the same way. No, I don't blame the people of Tonga for helping put a fascist into office on the other side of the planet. But is it not a stain on all humanity when this happens? Is it not a reflection of the worst of all we are? And should it not be an equal warning to all mankind to resist the twin evils of greed and apathy, under which almost all evils devised by people could be categorized?\n\nI look at the left blaming the DNC and liberals for Trump's victory, and Dems blaming pretty much everyone. But this was a collective loss: it is to the detriment of the entire human race and therefore we must all shoulder responsibility, reflect on how we let things get to this point, and ask ourselves how we can eliminate fascist tendencies root and stem. We owe it to future generations to take this responsibility.\n\nI regret that I have waited so long in my life to commit to mutual aid and strengthening ties to our local community. I hope current events help snap many others out of their apathy or nihilism, and commit to helping others and bringing happiness to those around them.

In my opinon since 1945 the people in a west turned a blind eye on far-right, because they thought fascism would never happen and resurface of more hateful far-right is impossible.

(Plus, the low engagement and interest to push ideas like that, while some stupid leftist memes online get 2k engagement and likes.)\n\nWe have the technology for instant connections, yet no coordinated platform for the working class, disabled individuals, or anyone needing assistance with daily problems people face. Imagine if there was an app that made it as easy to find a volunteer for grocery shopping, help with transportation, or skill-sharing as it is to find a used couch or a date. Instead, we have communities full of people needing support and others willing to offer it, but no accessible way to bring them together.\n\nSome might argue that funding such a platform would be the main challenge, but I\u2019m not convinced that\u2019s the biggest issue. We see individuals crowdfunding significant amounts of money on platforms like GoFundMe all the time. Plus, with the collective strength of leftist communities, crowdfunding and mutual aid for setup and upkeep costs (like server hosting) would be achievable if the right people coordinated it.\n\nWhat we really need is for IT professionals who are committed to mutual aid to offer their skills voluntarily to put this idea into practice and I refusd to believe there are no leftist ITers out there (in particular cause so many people in IT will do random projects to boost their portfolio). \n\n1. Backend Developer\/DevOps - Luckily, we already have someone for this role who can handle the server, databases, and other infrastructure.\n2. Frontend Developer - To build a responsive and accessible interface for web and mobile.\n3. UI\/UX Designer - To make the platform intuitive, inclusive, and welcoming for all users.\n4. QA Tester - To ensure everything functions well across devices and meets accessibility standards.\n\nBeyond tech skills, we\u2019d need people dedicated to keeping the platform financially sustainable and accessible. Ideally, we\u2019d have folks committed to organizing mutual aid and gathering ongoing resources to help with monthly maintenance, like server costs, and finding volunteers for outreach \/advertising the platform. \n\nPolitical ideologies are hollow if they don\u2019t translate into practical action, and I truly believe that if we had an easy way to connect, thousands of people would be eager to offer time, resources, or skills for their communities. Yes, grassroots organizing through local groups is vital, but let\u2019s be real, many community orgs struggle to meet the needs of all members, especially disabled and low-income folks. Many don\u2019t even provide basic accommodations, like masking, which excludes some people from even participating.\n\nSo, if you're a leftist IT professional or just someone with resources or passion for mutual aid, let\u2019s make this happen. Reach out to me, and let\u2019s talk about building a platform that can truly bring mutual aid into our communities in a sustainable, accessible way. \n\n(And yes I understand \"it is all not THAT easy\", but nothing about our lives is \"easy\". That should not be used as an argument to avoid helping eachother). \n\n"},{"created_date":"2024-11-08T06:49:37.000","sentiment_score":-0.9886903763,"sentiment_label":"NEGATIVE","text":"What To Do Now Part 2: Continued Intro To Anarchist Websites There are many resources for anarchists online, but I rarely see them here.
