It is mainly understood as meaning people who are particularly nationalist, typically in a way that sees to openly value their own nationality above others.\n\nYet, nationalism is in truth extremely prevalent, across almost the whole political spectrum, and on every level in society. People ask a foreign-seeming person where they come from to learn their *true* nationality, everyone must have a nationality associated with them in our record-keeping systems, rhetoric drawing from nationalism is prevalent among all parliamentary politics no matter the party (\"We fight for the brighter future for Americans!\", a statement basically any American politician could put out).\n\nNationalism has become so internalized and so presupposed and so naturalized that there isn't even a word left to describe it.\n\nThat, to me, is alarming and sad. For that to change, somehow, it should be once again made obvious that chauvinist nationalism and this sort of \"hidden\", everyday, unnamed nationalism are basically simply the same thing of different strengths.\n\nMichael Billig coined the term \"banal nationalism\" for this. But I doubt that's a term that's going to see much use; *banal* is also negative.\n\nInstead, what I think might be good would be to just commonly and often call this out as what it is - nationalism. No tippy-toeing, if an argument or a rhetoric or a phrase is rooted in nationalist thinking or presupposes nation states, we call it what it is - nationalism.",

Historically, anarchist thinkers like Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin were opposed to marxism, not aligned with it. Bakunin, for example, saw Marx\u2019s \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d as just another form of authoritarianism that would inevitably lead to oppression\u2014something history proved correct.\n\nThe term anarcho-communism comes largely from Kropotkin, but when he (and other 19th-century thinkers) used the word \u201ccommunism,\u201d they were describing a hypothetical stateless society\u2014one that had never existed. After the Russian Revolution, communism became a concrete, real-world system associated with centralized authoritarian states like the Soviet Union. So why are people still using the term anarcho-communism today, when communism now represents state control and authoritarianism? It\u2019s completely contradictory to attach anarchism\u2014a philosophy of anti-authoritarianism\u2014to a term that has become synonymous with government control.\n\nThe reality is that modern leftist and activist groups have co-opted anarchism, blending it into a vague, trendy brand of \u201canti-capitalism\u201d that serves their own agenda. They take the aesthetics of rebellion while injecting anarchism with socialist and marxist ideas\u2014ideologies that are inherently dependent on centralized power and state control. But true anarchism is diametrically opposed to socialism and marxism because those ideologies require a governing force, whether it\u2019s a state or a so-called \u201cpeople\u2019s collective.\u201d Anyone claiming to be an anarchist while advocating for socialism or marxism is either deeply misinformed or deliberately misleading.\n\nIs this historical ignorance, or is it a deliberate ideological hijacking?",

I hope Todd Howard doesn't sue me for this.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1iezwyh22bje1.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e0bbcf2cad48578aee834636b971f55a0af29b4)\n\n  \nMy channel name SKULL means \"South Korean Ultimate Library for Libertarians\". Tell me it is a cool name.\n\n[My banner. From top left: Paris Commune, Makhnovists, Kronstadt Rebels, KPAM members, CNT-FAI unionist, Black Panther Party, Zapatistas, Kurdish YPJ, and Syriac\\\/Assyrian HSNB. \\(If you are a Jew, I'm sorry.

I tried my best.\n\nSo, apart from bragging about my works, now I'm gonna talk more seriously. Now after I uploaded my first video, I'm planning on uploading about 10 videos for about 3 years. (After 3 years I take Korean SAT and go to college.) However, turns out I have no clue on which documentary is good to introduce to Koreans!\n\n  \nThe next work I have half a mind to do is translating[ this ](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f0OVvi29Pm0)and [this](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3HAw8vqczJw), though I haven't asked permission from Vice. (Actually, if someone has financial loss due to my copyright violation, the person would be a capitalist. Right?) However, I think I would enjoy receiving advice from you. **So, would you kindly introduce to me fruitful documentaries that can be used without copyright violation about**:\n\n\\-Paris Commune\n\n\\-Makhnovshchina, Kronstadt Rebellion, Korean People's Association in Manchuria, and CNT-FAI\n\n\\-New Left and Revolution in 1968, particularly Black Panther Party\n\n\\-EZLN and inspired alter-globalization movements\n\n\\-Feminist works promoted by PKK &amp; YPG\/YPJ (Kurdish), Dawronoye (Syriac\/Assyrian), SDF, etc.\n\n\\-Antifa movements in the Western world\n\n\\-Anything else!\n\n  \nI would be more than glad if you come up with a good idea on my works.\n\n  \nTL;DR\n\n1. I started my own YouTube for translation.\n\n2. But I dunno what good videos I can translate to Korean.\n\n3. So I wish you could tell me some.\n\n",

        "selftext":"Cultural anthropology in a nutshell: Human life occurs in group realities, lived systems of concepts and practices, meanings and activities, that lay out the structures and contents of worlds of experience.\n\nThe worlds of experience built out of meanings and practices that we occupy and enact include forms of agency and personhood, general structures of intention and desire, general conceptions of self and others, and the social and physical terrain of everyday life.\n\nWe are socialized into group realities, with their particular systems of concepts and practices, which we then produce and reproduce as we enact ourselves and live our everyday lives using the available symbolic and material resources.\n\nSociocultural realities (group enactments of worlds of experience and practice) are potentially (and usually) constituted with various forms of inequality and domination built in. Building inequality into daily life generally benefits the privileged by making it hard to see from the inside, where the inequality may appear \u201cnatural.\u201d Thus, people can enact inequality, as either privileged or subordinated, as they enact everyday life, without being fully aware of what they are doing.  \n  \nAnthropology raises (but mostly avoids addressing too clearly) the question of what we can do about the realities we live in. Does having a good higher-order theory of human reality, language, and power enable us to develop a better \u2018language-practice\u2019 that could facilitate the construction of better realities, based not on power concentration but on democracy, freedom, time, love, or whatever other values groups of like-minded people decide are best for them at any given moment? I don\u2019t see any good reason not to be optimistic, to believe (even as faith if necessary, as it probably is) that groups of humans acting in good will have the capacity \u2014 the freedom and the ability \u2014 to create much much better ways of living than we\u2019ve got going now.\n\n",

        "selftext":"\nThis version keeps the revolutionary tone and key terminology while avoiding terms that could be get it taken down. I had to run the old words of the durruti group through a PC AI to soften and tone down the 1930s anarchist lanuage to  be more sensitive and anti-oppressive ironically.\n\nThe collapse of an anarchist revolution that had everything in its favor was a pivotal moment. The Durruti group identified key structural weaknesses and sought to address them to prevent similar failures in future anarchist movements.\n\nThey followed apolitical theories to their logical conclusion and recognized a critical issue: the absence of political decision-making structures necessary for the coordination necessary to sustain the revolution.\n\nIn 1938, they proposed a program with a strategic adjustment to anarchism. How influential have their insights and warnings been on contemporary 21st-century anarchist thought in the West?\n\nOur Programme\nRevolutions cannot succeed without clear objectives and direction. The July Revolution demonstrated this shortcoming\u2014while the CNT had the strength, it lacked a cohesive plan to channel revolutionary energy. Leaders were caught off guard and uncertain about how to proceed. The result was hesitation at a moment when decisive action was essential, ultimately leading to the revolution\u2019s loss.\n\nThese critical junctures leave no room for uncertainty. There must be a clear path forward. We aim to address this gap, ensuring that the lessons of July and May are never repeated.\n\nTo this end, we propose a strategic modification to anarchism: the establishment of a Revolutionary Junta.\n\nThe revolution requires organized bodies to oversee and defend it against hostile elements. Experience has shown that opposition will not simply fade away\u2014it must be confronted. While some anarchist comrades may have ideological concerns, the reality of events demands that we take a firm stance.\n\nIf we wish to avoid repeating past mistakes, we must act decisively against forces that do not align with the interests of the working class.\n\nKey Proposals:\n1. Establishment of a Revolutionary Junta or National Defense Council.\n\nThis body will be formed through democratic elections within union organizations. Consideration will be given to those at the front, ensuring their right to representation.\nThe Junta will not interfere in economic matters, which remain under union control.\nFunctions of the Junta include:\nCoordinating defense and managing the war effort.\nMaintaining revolutionary stability.\nHandling international affairs.\nConducting revolutionary outreach.\nPositions will rotate regularly to prevent entrenchment, with trade union assemblies exercising oversight.\n2. Economic Power to the Syndicates.\n\nSince July, unions have demonstrated their ability to manage economic production effectively. Their role must be fully recognized and elevated.\nAn Economic Council, aligned with industrial federations, may be established to enhance coordination.\n3. Free Municipality.\n\nBefore foreign rule, Spain had a strong tradition of municipal autonomy. This decentralized model must be revived to prevent the formation of a new state system.\nIn the new society, governance will be handled by local municipalities, supported by unions. Since all members of society will be producers, there will be no inherent conflicts of interest.\nMunicipalities will be organized into local, regional, and national federations, maintaining strong ties with the unions at every level.\nTowards a Fresh Revolution.",

        "selftext":"I'm two years out of highschool and studying at a community college. My father has been a blue collar worker his whole life and made it known to me that I'll regret it if I led the life he did in construction, and in the mill. Every since 9th grade, though I was slightly conservative then, I despised the idea of work. Not work in itself, but a life of work, because to me life felt antithetical to it. Now, as I'm receiving an education, I feel more and more despair reading the news and seeing the state of the world. Reading history of stateless and\/or horizontal societies don't bring me much hope either. I just want to live in a world where whatever work I do feels important, like it fulfills a purpose, as this one makes it feel almost worthless. \n\nToday I was planning to join a group reading, at a local anarchist collective (unlucky, an ice storm hit), but mostly for finding community. I suppose the point of this post is that I'm feeling anarchism, or any other anti-capitalist movement for that matter, is a lost cause considering how dominant our economic and political structures are. Learning about the world only depresses me more. So, why should I feel anarchism will gain any wider engagement, or at least enough to be effective? After all, if we did we would surely be warred against until we had no capacity to serve ourselves.\n\nI want to be hopeful, maybe, at the very least, I will help a movement persist beyond my own life. As AI progresses, however, it feels as if the rich (who have exclusive control over its use) will dictate the course of history just as before. \n\nI can't tell if I've lost hope because anarchism is really only a buffer on the system, or if I am becoming more depressed learning about it.

        "selftext":"Hi everyone.  I hope this post finds you well and with some nourishment and loved ones bringing colour into your life.  I wanted to inquire with this sub about some existential questions I am having regarding my own life path, and I guess a request for some advice.\n\nI am a white settler (30m) currently living in a city where I've been for the past 6 years.  I was not born here but I have developed many good relationships here with people, projects, and the land.  I spent my first 4 years here involved in activism and advocacy, particularly regarding housing justice, until I 'burned out' and my energy output became unsustainable.  Since that time two years ago, I've been struggling to reorient my life path towards meaningful, longterm projects.  The reality of rent, food prices, traffic congestion, etc. is, of course, fairly suffocating. I have found my own ways to manage but systemically I don't have faith in things getting better.\n\nPresently, I have some good friends living in a rural area 2 hours from the city, who would gladly welcome me into their community.  Most amenities are 15-45 minutes away but there is plentiful access to land, and good soil for farming\/gardening.  I have access to an offgrid land project with dear friends where we could live ruggedly and supporting one another.  There are many enticing things about this rural life: the directness of growing my own food, fetching my own water, firewood, building structures from scraps, doing all of this with friends. But I have some hangups.  Namely, I feel that I would be \"cashing in\" on my whiteness and intergenerational wealth in a way that compromises my values, i.e. prioritizing my own comfort over vulnerable strangers, inevitably dedicating a higher proportion time &amp; energy to off-grid chores, driving, etc.  Of course there would be the possibility of developing more relationships with locals and creating mutual aid projects.  And even though it is a very white region, there are historic Black and Indigenous communities \\~30-40 minutes away that I could develop more of a relationship with. Ultimately, I'm struggling to shake the idea that \"the city\" is where I should be because of it's density of \"important frontlines of social struggle,\" and I also really enjoy its internationalist nature, density of young people, sometimes night-life...\n\nPerhaps my internal conflict of \"anarchism in the city vs. the country\" is unnecessarily dualistic, yet it feels true that they are very different lifestyles.   With the reduced stress of living rurally (rent-free baby!) I would enjoy dedicating more time to writing, researching, and possibly even publishing anarchist histories.  Other than that I don't exactly have a skilled trade, but I have made myself handy for carpentry &amp; construction jobs in the past.\n\nAny resources, insights, or experiences you feel compelled to share would be greatly beneficial to me.  I appreciate you taking time to read this.  In solidarity !",

        "selftext":"\"TL;DR: I need formal education and credentials to survive and eventually reform\/overthrow the system, but I deeply oppose its reductionist, oppressive, and anti-neurodivergent approach. I want libertarian education that embraces doubt, critical thinking, and diverse ways of knowing. Currently trapped between institutional survival and my anarchist epistemology, looking for perspectives on navigating this contradiction without losing myself in the process.\"\n\nI've been doing exhausting research and reading several posts about education in this subreddit.\n\nI'm new here and I'm mainly looking for like-minded people, who are so rare to meet in Italy.\n\nI've always been an unorthodox student. I live in Italy, I'm autistic and gifted, and I live with a chronic disabling condition. I have no family. My autistic condition has made me particularly devoted to science, and over the years my reflections and way of thinking have naturally drawn me closer to anarchist thought, particularly its ecological and communitarian current. Perhaps I'm more anarchist than I realize!\n\nThroughout my life journey, I have experienced systematic discrimination and abuse, istitutional too: at university, in high school, and in the communities where I lived as a minor. My unconventional way of thinking, giftedness, political practices, and specific needs related to my atypicality were certainly catalyzing elements of these experiences of marginalization and violence. These continuous social pressure and discrimination have led me to develop deep depression.\n\nI consider anarchism as a possible foundation for an ethical epistemological paradigm that aspires to overcome fragmented, reductionist knowledge. My passion for study and reading, which I experience as acts of subversion, has progressively distanced me from contemporary institutions. In ten years of professional experience across public, private, cooperatives, and NGOs, I have observed how neoliberal ideology and kyriarchy have corrupted ideals, principles, and projects at every level, especially in Italy.\n\nCurrently, I do a job I love - I dedicate myself, besides obsessive studying, to advocacy and support for young people who grew up without families - but it's economically undervalued. I live in poverty. In our country, which I deeply love for its language, food, climate, and geography, working conditions for neurodivergent and disabled people are extremely problematic. I also strongly oppose English as a lingua franca (I'm sorry for native-english), both for socio-political reasons and due to my neurodivergent needs. Therefore, leaving Italy is not the most immediate option for me.\n\nI've enrolled in university to continue my studies, but I'm increasingly convinced that mass education pursues objectives far from learning quality and the development of critical thinking and autonomy - fundamental elements for forming individuals capable of contributing to their own, their community and nature's well-being. The degree appears increasingly necessary, but the meritocratic competition for scholarships, combined with the self-referential nature of the Italian system, requires conforming one's cognitive processes to a pathological system and assimilating beliefs that don't belong to me. The elimination of doubt in institutions, evidently considered subversive, is another significant issue.\n\nMy purpose is to conduct research in the sociology of institutionalized knowledge and in epistemic justic to overturn my country's educational system. I strongly believe that the way to an anti-oppressive and equitable society parts of education. However, to gain acknowledgment, credentials, and economic support (just enough to survive, haha), I must follow the institutional path.\n\nHow can I overcome this impasse?",

First, not every anarchist would agree with me, but I would hope most would. Second, Trump and Musk are not tearing down the government completely, they are tearing down the things standing in the way of their ability to amass more power and more money. Third, Anarchy is not a top-down process. Without the bottom up approach where communities are built upon mutual trust and mutual aid, the swift removal of parts of the US government can only lead to greater chaos. With the bottom up approach, communities learn to work together in mutually beneficial ways, cooperating for the benefit of all and removing their reliance on corporations and governments. Governments would dissolve because there is no need for them, corporations would dissolve because they would be replaced by individuals cooperating for the benefit of all. Anarchism, despite popular belief, is not synonymous with chaos, and what Trump and Musk are doing is simply causing chaos for the sake of a fascist power grab.\"\n\nThis is a watered down and simplified version of the exchange, but I'm curious if you all agree, or what your thoughts are on the current actions being taken to reduce many aspects of the American government by Trump and his team.",

        "selftext":"Hi everyone, I\u2019d like to start a discussion about the use of the term *fascism* and whether it remains a useful category for analyzing contemporary political phenomena from an anarchist perspective.\n\nIn many political debates today, especially within antifascist circles, the term *fascism* is frequently used to describe authoritarian right-wing projects and figures such as Trump, Bolsonaro, or Elon Musk. However, I wonder if this usage is still analytically helpful or if, on the contrary, it oversimplifies the issue and prevents a deeper understanding.\n\n**Personally, I believe that antifascism as an ethical horizon will always be relevant.** However, labeling figures like Musk or Trump as \"fascist\" seems problematic to me. Even if they share authoritarian and reactionary elements, applying this label often turns them into mere *Hollywood villains*, making it easier for them to reject the accusation and weaken the critique. Additionally, this broad use of *fascism* may prevent us from identifying the specific characteristics of today\u2019s political and economic landscape, such as **corporate capitalism** or **techno-feudalism**.\n\nAuthors like **Murray Bookchin, Peter Gelderloos, and Noam Chomsky** have criticized the indiscriminate use of the term *fascism*, arguing that applying it to any contemporary form of authoritarianism can be misleading. Instead, they suggest analyzing power structures within capitalism, colonialism, and broader hierarchical systems. (**Edit: I originally made a mistake regarding Chomsky. In fact, he does use the term** ***fascism*** **quite broadly. Thanks to a response from DvD\\_Anarchist on this post, I can now clarify this.**)\n\nSome questions I\u2019d like to explore:\n\n* To what extent does *fascism*, in its historical sense (Mussolini, Hitler, etc.), remain a valid category for understanding today\u2019s authoritarianism?\n* Does the overuse of *fascism* reduce complex political phenomena to historical comparisons instead of analyzing them in their own context?\n* From an anarchist perspective, is it more useful to focus on power structures and hierarchy in general rather than labeling certain movements as \"fascist\"?\n* What do you think of the critiques from Bookchin, Gelderloos, and Chomsky on this topic? Are there other anarchist thinkers who address this issue?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and any relevant bibliography on the subject. Thanks!",

        "selftext":"Despair is just the long way to apathy.\n\nThat's one of the biggest tricks that centers of power use to silence dissent and stop any action against them: Deny that a problem exists until it's so obvious and so bad that nobody can ignore it, and then say there's nothing we can do at this point, so why bother? We've seen this happen with capitalism and the record-breaking difference between the rich and poor, we've seen it with climate change, and we've seen it with the loss of our privacy. Right now - especially in the US - it seems like there's more interest in internet privacy than there's been in a long time, but when people look into it and find out how far we are from being truly private, they get discouraged. We're being pulled in 2 different directions: \"We can't really do anything\" and \"We can't just do nothing.\"\n\nIf that's how you feel, you're not alone. But your privacy is definitely still worth taking back.\n\n#1. Surveillance isn't free.\n\nCorporations and governments have a lot of money, energy, and computing power to track people, but it's not infinite. The most intensive types of surveillance (the ones that involve dedicated experts, complex deanonymization techniques, and things like that) are mostly saved for high-level targets like terrorists and military agents. The basic level of surveillance they do on everyone is all passive: automatically logging information about you as you live your life.\n\nAnything you do to separate yourself from their trackers stops a little of that. Doing something as simple as switching your browser to a more private one, or disabling location or Google apps on your phone, or deleting apps you don't need and logging out of social media, means 1 less source of information about your life that can be tracked.\n\nAre more serious measures worth learning and doing? Absolutely, because privacy is freedom. The more dissenting, threatening to power, or targeted you are, the more private you need to be. But it's not all-or-nothing, and you can get better at it over time.\n\nEspecially because of the second reason:\n\n#2. Information goes out of date.\n\nIt's a common belief that once your information is out there, there's no use protecting it. But almost everything about you changes over time, so if someone stops being able to track you, eventually what they know about you will be less useful. Maybe you don't go to the same places or talk to the same people as you used to. Maybe your beliefs and opinions changed. Maybe you have a different job, a different computer or phone, a different bank account or card than you did before. For all they know, maybe you changed your name and moved out of the country. Each piece of information you keep someone from getting is information that might not be true anymore.\n\nOne big exception is your DNA, which is why everyone should stay away from things like 23andMe and Ancestry.\n\n#3. Privacy is a community effort.\n\nStaying private would be impossible if you were the only one doing it. If everyone is leaving their data out in the open and you're the only one keeping it secret, you'll stand out more than anyone else - but if everyone is securing their privacy, it's there for people who need it most. And secure messages, group chats, and file sharing are only secure if *everyone* keeps that information safe.\n\nPlus, privacy is only accessible because of open-source projects and the people who develop them, almost always for free, as well as those who learn privacy and security so they can help each other with it. Without that, only the best security experts could keep their data private.\n\nAnd in a worst-case scenario, if *everything* goes wrong and they catch you doing something that really pisses them off, there's nothing like people you can trust around you, who will have your back and not snitch on you, and will remember you and visit you in jail if it comes to that.\n\nThe ultimate point of surveillance is fear, because without fear it's hard to control someone.\n\nSo let's take our control back, little by little.",

I am often critical of the possibility of actually effecting any real change through government, because it is the enemy after all. But I have considered after law school, I start next autumn, pursuing politics with the idea of at least keeping other politicians in check lol. But do not know how this would even work.\n\n1. Would an Anarchist openly declare themselves as such, putting themselves at odds with the status quo and likely reducing the odds of being elected?\n\n2. Would an Anarchist be better served by \u201cplaying the game\u201d with an intent to reach higher offices in hopes of bringing about change more effectively?\n\n3.

State.gov had a pdf on DEIA that was removed Nov 2024. If these are such bad things why is the other side (the one in control not the people's side) making it obviously harder to find information about? \n\nSo as we know that DEI is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Before recent times, most people never heard of it or did and forgot (myself included). What I was surprised to hear was that its actually been DEIA they've been going after which now stands for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, AND Accessibility. It makes sense why the country founded on racism would want to make it seem like they're being racist cause thats what was ran on. So it makes sense that if you remove the word Accessibility from the equation, it makes it seem like its about race when in reality its been much more than that. [Didn't a certain fascist make common knowledge harder to obtain through the used-to-be available means at the time (i.e. newspapers, books, articles)? \/rhetorical]\n\nListen if you made it this far, I know we've gone passed the point of \"Words don't help\".

        "selftext":"I've had this thought; people HATE mainstream media nowadays. I'm talking liberals, fascists, hell it's somehow managed to piss the entire left off. Many people point to Fox, WSJ, NYT and other dominant news sources for their direct role in \"sanewashing\" fascists, presenting horrible, democracy-ending news as normal, and generally just being propaganda. \n\nSee, the usual workaround to the liberal propaganda in recent years was independent journalism or just direct information on platforms like Twitter, TikTok, Instagram sorta and other online platforms, or relying on Google algorithms to promote their websites. The issue now is that those platforms have basically decided to censor everything that doesn't suck on fascist cock, so nobody is able to get their usual news from crowdsources or whatever. People are actually listening to local news and national news with fresh ears and finding it to be distasteful.\n\nThere is a demand in the general public for honest, truthful news about shit, and they aren't getting it online. They aren't getting it in their current newspapers either. Anarchists have done much work to get their message out but censorship and state repression of our ideas has blocked the reach of our ideas for many years. I propose a solution: \n\nPrint media! \n\nZines, posters, fliers, and even established papers such as Slingshot. Make them and spread them around! Hand them out to people while tabling on college campuses. Staple fliers to telephone poles. Throw out pointless bourgeois magazines from those \"free\" things and replace them with propaganda! \n\nI think the most important thing here is to remember to bring some proper journalism along with you. Write an essay about the actions going on in DC. Write about the truth of fascist deregulation causing deadly aviation accidents. Write protest reports! If you gain the public trust, you gain their ears. It's far easier to deprogram normies and liberals when they actually enjoy reading your shit",

There\u2019s been an abundance of those who are newly radicalized, ready to become revolutionaries. Rightfully so, outrage has the masses standing on business. Those who\u2019ve been rooted should feel a responsibility to guide. Yes, there will be waves of people on the frontlines, but does it prove efficient that be your \u201cstation\u201d? \n\nI don\u2019t mean for the above to sound condescending.   Instead, a genuine plea that if you feel involved, please consider your stance. We\u2019ve long fought the rise of this becoming; many groups formed in unison. Yet, they still inflate themselves with non-existing power, desecrating all voices unaligned, whether it be as a whisper or a gaggle. The organizing took place when your core values either aligned with or urged against this chauvinistic bullshit. Throughout the era\u2019s, the fight has taken place. Strategizing is the only way we\u2019ll overcome this.\n\nIt\u2019s as though we\u2019ve become so desensitized to headlines bold with \u201cunprecedented\u201d that we\u2019re now ready to die for change. Don\u2019t allow \u201cmartyr\u201d to become hot press. Regardless of what radicalized you, do not effortlessly let radicalization become the end of you. That fight you felt is survival for all. How quickly we\u2019ll be eradicated, charging forward prepared to die if needed. No, prepare to stand your ground at all costs. Those costs being any means to protect and persevere. Ironically, we are the heritage foundation. We are in need of protecting history, arts, architecture, science, theologies, and literature. Enforcing the removal of false narratives and the rhetoric whitewashing of it all. Return culture and protect those indigenous to the practices. Understand economics and political science but refuse contributions of that knowledge to the undeserving. Make an example of how infrastructure does not equate to industrialism nor capitalism. Prove that this is all possible while prioritizing humanity.\n \nThe ideal objective is to dismantle and discard crony capitalism, kleptocracy, patriarchs, oligarchs, fascism, elitism, misogyny, racism, police state - I mean fuck, for a crew to complain that LGTBQ was too long, they\u2019ve sure pulled their fair share of the alphabet. To go against such will be tedious. An argument could be made from my \u201cabolish all government\u201d babes. Ashes too can be viewed as tiny little fragments remaining of a system now applied to the future as nothing more than a goddamn example. Just remember to go after the throats of the oppressors, not the oppressed, and be wise enough to know the difference. Still a complete cog in the system seeking fair justice and liberty for all with perhaps a sprinkle of order? You\u2019ll need to be careful with the disassembling as you\u2019re looking to reconstruct. All sides should remain open to the idea of direct democracy on some scale.\n\nThis thought became urgent to share when topics regarding 2\/5 protests became large-scale. Some of the more linear thought processes I\u2019ve witnessed debate whether it is a trap or not. The argument being that it doesn\u2019t matter; solidarity is key. I completely agree that solidarity is key and should be the fundamental. You can protest in solidarity many ways. Before you stand in front of your capital, \nBuildings ask who is defenseless and vulnerable in the neighborhood over. Did we take advice on protecting ourselves from a surveillance state while accidentally whistleblowing an ally? Did we become irrational from fear? Yes, the masses need to be in the streets standing up for what\u2019s right, but how many of us need to be in front of a building full of government officials that have done absolutely nothing aside from proving they can\u2019t read your signs nor hear your words? To most of them, you\u2019re fanatical. Take your march to the border, to neighborhoods of culture and diversity, to domestic violence shelters where they are already being attacked. Stay true to your pacifist nature if needed by supporting local communities. Read books to the children scared, bring groceries to the families hiding, be ready to stand for them while strengthening them. Embrace spatial awareness and you\u2019d be shocked at the many ways you fight. I fear while we are so focused on what will come of Wednesday, they will be going after our most vulnerable. What a waste it would be, to finally have opened your eyes to the reality, only to succumb to its wrath.",

        "title":"Safety tips for protests",
        "selftext":"With the tension rising in... pretty much anywhere, and having seen some threads in here about protests, I thought we could do a little thread about safety tips for protests. I'll start by contributing what I know and what I lived, and everyone can add stuff from their own experiences. Maybe we'll disagree on some points, but it's all for giving advices to people to make sure they stay safe. (Note: Also any advices here not encouraging anyone to talk about illegal stuff online, because those advices are about \\*safety\\* and talking about illegal stuff online definitely isn't safe.)\n\nI'm not the guy with the most experience doing radical stuff during protest. But I'll still share what I have. It's mostly about \"What to do if you don't want to get arrested\", and mostly rely on being able to avoid getting stuck in complicated situations in the first place.\n\n1:  \nIn 2012 (student strike in Qu\u00e9bec), I was arrested not following a protest, but 3 months after it, because our local police had nothing else to do (Small rural city), and they wanted to file who were among the students of that specific protest in which we had blocked an exit from a public park after the prime minister came there. I wasn't even among the most radical people there at the time. I was just standing next to them, and cops happened to take my picture. It's part of what radicalized me, really. I had only stopped a guy from falling because he had been shoved by the police, and I myself tried to avoid contact with police as much as possible.\n\n\\&gt;So yeah, avoid getting close to the police because even if they don't touch you, even if you're not doing anything specifically illegal, they can find ways to arrest you if they want. Be aware of any officer further back who might be filming or taking pictures. If you spot them, (and don't want to be arrested), move away from the hot spots\n\n2:\n\nIn 2015, I went to a protest in Montreal. It was taking place just after the anarchist bookfair, and was part of the wave of student protest against austerity measures. I was at the anarchist bookstore, and saw around 50 people marching so I just joined them. I had shirts in my bag, and ski goggles, just in case.  \nThey went to up to a street, I don't remember which, I don't know Montreal enough. It was a pedestrian street for the summer, but the cops suddenly drove in with minivans, just a bit faster than the retreating protesters were running. When the protesters where moving to the sides, the minivan stopped. Cops in riot gear got out of the minivans and grabbed the students that just got out of the vans' path. I had already moved to the sides as soon as the vans had showed up. There were not enough people to go and take them back.\n\n\\&gt; Don't stay in the streets if the protest can't hold it anymore (When you don't have the critical mass anymore). Move to the sides and keep your distance.  You can only hold a spot against the police if there are many, many more of you than there are of them, and you still need good protective equipment to do so, and it won't last forever.\n\n3:\n\nA bit later, during the same protest, I followed a group of C\u00e9gep students to the front of their college. Someone came and said that many of their friends were stuck in a kettle and they wanted to do something about it. I didn't want my picture taken again, so I used the shirts and ski google to become part of the black-bloc.\n\nBut while I was following the group, we came to an intersection. The street to the left was flanked by cops. So I stayed on the right side of the group. Seeing that all the people I was with were turning left between two rows of cops, I tried to say something, but quickly just left the protest and hid behind some brick pillar in front of a commerce entrance. When looking at the street, the cops had wheeled behind the small group I was with. They were now being kettled. I turned around the city block a while, found another protester that had been separated. We left the spot, and I had them check out while I was finding an isolated spot to remove my black shirts and goggles.\n\nUnder my t-shirt, I had a white, XVIIIth century style shirt and coat whose sleeves I had rolled up under the t-shirt. The person I was with told be: \"You don't look like a protester\". That was the point.\n\n\\&gt;Learn to recognize the signs of a kettle. Have disposable clothes if you want to conceal your identity. Avoid profiling by not looking like someone who would go to protests  (I know that last one is entirely dependant on privilege, but do your best)\n\n4:\n\nA few months earlier, we had taken part in a protest in winter in my rural homecity. I had a big red and black flag. I was masked, but my clothes were very noticeable. Me and my friend of the time did the protest, nothing illegal, but we still slowed traffic which is such a crime in the eyes of rural people... Coming back from the protest, we waited at our University. After a little while, we left, passed through a little wood to my appartment, but in the street of my appartment, we got stopped by police who questionned us, illegally asked us for our names and adress saying that IF we didn't comply we would be arrested. Of course they wanted our names so they would have files on the local protestors because we're a small city and there are not a lot of us out there.\n\n\\&gt;This is the counter-example to the last trick. A mask won't save you if your clothes are still recognizable and if you don't throw away your disguise in a spot that won't be seen. Also, scout ahead, even - or should I say - ESPECIALLY after the protest. Protests ends, but there are cops working around the clock and if they want to harass protestors, they can just wait for the protest to end and target people when they go back home, isolated and vulnerable.\n\n5:  \nIn 2017, there were protests organized by racist group \"La Meute\" (wolf-pack) in Qu\u00e9bec city. A bunch of reactionnary protesting against immigration. It was around the end of november, IIRC. There was a counter-protest organized by different leftwing organizations at the same time.  \nI went there with a few friends from my small city, a 2 hour car ride away.\n\nI was dressed with a good looking coat, something someone \"professional\" would wear. I walked here and there to try and scout things a bit. I went all the way up to the rightwing protest, and then came back down to our counter-protest. When I arrived, there was already a police line pushing on counter-protestors, many of which had white traces of maalox in their face to treat the pepper spray. I was behind the police line, they were on my right. I walked up to the foot of the Qu\u00e9bec wall near the parliament.\n\nI turned right in the little park that was empty and went back toward the parliament and the counter-protestors. A bit further back, a new police line was forming, flanking the more peaceful parts of the protest.  \nI feigned innocence and asked the police to pass. They allowed me to do so.  \nI went back into the protest and warned people that a kettle was forming up. Many more liberal counter-protestors told me that it wouldn't happen there.  \nI found the people I came to Qu\u00e9bec with, and told them it was time to leave.\n\nThe kettle was forming up. Near the parliament, there is a medieval-like wall in Qu\u00e9bec, with a big door for the cars to pass through, and smaller doors on the sidewalks. A policeman with a dog was standing there. We were far enough from the rest of the protest that we didn't look like part of it.  \nA policeman on the wall told another one that we could go through. The one with the dog said we couldn't. So I told him: \"Sorry sir, but your colleague on the wall told us to go. Can we know which one we must listen to first?\" He told us \"Okay you can go\".  \nWe went and reunited with other people of our region in a small cafe, waited an hour and then left Qu\u00e9bec city.\n\nWe learned later that a few of our friends from Montreal, and one of our guy from our city, were arrested a bit further away, they were still forming a black bloc.\n\n\\&gt;Once again, if you don't have the critical mass, leave. If you see cops forming new lines on the sides of a protest, leave. Be able to become unnoticeable. Blend yourself in the crowd of ordinary people just walking by. People will say to stay in group.  \nThis is only good when standing your ground, and this can only be done if you're in numerical superiority.  \nSooner or later, the protest will scatter and cops will start targeting those smaller groups going home. Or the protest will just be kettled.\n\nYou need to know when it's starting to happen to be able to scatter and leave just before that. I'd even recommend people who decide to organize protests to adopt a \"guerilla\" style of protests: Do the protests with ordinary-looking people scouting ahead. At the first sign of cops, signal, scatter, and reconvene at another point.",

What happens when the auth-comms show up instead? You can say it doesn\u2019t matter, but history says otherwise. Occupy started as an anarchist movement and still got stolen. Why? Because anarchists were there first but didn\u2019t hold the ground.\n\nIf anarchists aren\u2019t showing up, who are we leaving this to? The same tankie organizers who will happily co-opt any movement that lacks a strong anti-state presence?

The state itself, which will push its own narrative in the absence of strong resistance?\n\nI don\u2019t buy the argument that this is some perfect \u201ctrap\u201d that can only result in failure. Of course the state responds to uprisings with repression\u2014that\u2019s how it works. But if people are out in the streets, being radicalized by the violence of the system, that\u2019s precisely where anarchists should be. If we\u2019re not, then others will shape the narrative. We\u2019ve seen it happen before.\n\nSo where is the strategy? Why aren\u2019t we salting this?\n\nSalting \u2013 when union organizers get jobs at non-union workplaces to organize from within. It works for labor, so why aren\u2019t we doing it for protest movements? Instead of armchair commentary, why aren\u2019t anarchists embedding themselves in these spaces to help push things further, keep them from getting co-opted, and actually make use of the energy that\u2019s already there?\n\nIf I\u2019m wrong, let\u2019s talk about it.

I think its easy to call for mass General strikes, but that takes a lot of planning and people would experience real harm by being out of work for what would likely need to be a multiple week strike. \n\n  \nMy proposal is this. Any left leaning person who has a mortgage should simply stop paying it. \n\n  \nThat's the elevator pitch, but more realistically the sudden loss of thousands of mortgage payments would cripple these banks. And its something that can be sustained for multiple months by the witholder. Month 1, you save $X amount of dollars. By month 2, they'll start making calls etc... Now you have $2x cash in your savings. MAYBE by month 3 they'll start making motions like they'll go to court. Maybe send a demand letter, it will be different in each state. But All in all, across each of the states, you'll likely have 3-6 months of being able to save up your mortgage payment, before they even get the courts involved. \n\n  \nNow here we are at month 6, this has become a movement (1000 people per state could be enough, but obviously more is better), banks are really feeling the pain of not having the cash, and now you all are sitting on 6 months of mortgage that you can keep as cash, (or likely will use it to help with any varrying emergencies that will spring up in the next few months of the Regime). They start moving to foreclose on these homes. Depending on your state, you could be looking at an additional 6 months to upto and beyone 24 months. Especially since we'll now be clogging the already strained court system with all of these foreclosure cases. (Most firms handling foreclosure have lowered staffing levels since the 2008-2012 US mortgage crisis, it would likely take them 1-2 years to fire back up to 2010 levels to now match the demand to even file the cases). \n\nSo, they blink. Then hey, no harm no foul, you've got the 6 months in the bank you can just bring everything current and we've had our demands met. If they don't, then as you can see, likely anyone who is fortunate to be in this situation would likely have 1-2 years to be able to weather this storm so it would likely be the Banks that crumble first. Only took about 2 weeks of witheld labor during the pandemic to realize that could make them cow. \n\n  \nWilling to workshop, but I think this could be an avenue to put pressure on the top from the middle.

        "selftext":"This is something I've been mulling over since the 2024 US Election. For years, the far-right has been backed by massive think-tanks like Prager University and the Daily Wire, spewing propaganda and fear that has shaped the narratives of the political right, often putting trans people square in the crosshairs alongside \"Illegals\" as an easy outgroup to represent the \"degeneration\" of society.\n\n  \nThe Right has formed a cult of personality around Trump, swallowing wholesale the red scare propaganda over the \"Communist\" Democrats, all while the Democrats gleefully skip behind them, trying to imitate them and pleasing absolutely no one. I only advocate for participating in Capitalist Democracy to keep the worst reactionaries out of power, as it's foolish to think the Democrats will stand up for anyone but the Capitalist class.\n\n\n\nBut as we've seen, when the Democrats fail to commit to standing up for human rights, giving wishy-washy none-answers like \"I'll follow the law\", people stay home. And when people stay home, the MAGA cult flocks out in droves to make their [idolatrine](https:\/\/genius.com\/Ghost-idolatrine-lyrics) the law of the land, further erasing human rights and enforcing Christian Nationalist brand Fascism.\n\n  \nThis brings me to my point about Anarchism. The simple truth of the matter is that we need more propaganda, more art, more literature, to drag this world kicking and screaming toward a better future. Already, mega entertainment corps like Disney are erasing overt trans representation in media to please their bigoted shareholders, walking back on the bare minimum token representation they already had.\n\n  \nWe cannot let the far-right [control the conversation](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CaPgDQkmqqM) any more than they already have. We've seen what happens when our so-called leaders refuse to offer any sufficient counter to these narratives, stuck in an endless loop of [we go low, you go high.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MAbab8aP4_A) We are watching in real time as the right uses culture war narratives to justify human rights atrocities, and since the Democrats are too preocupied with \"Playing by the rules\" (no matter how much the other side stacks the deck), we need to cut through the bullshit with our own propaganda, in conjunction with direct community-based action, to protect the lives of LGBTQ+ people and other targeted minorities.\n\n  \nEvery piece of art we make helps to further cement our place in culture, even when the state tries to censor us. Society is nothing without the individual actions of people collectively working to protect the persecuted. So even if all you can do is pick up a pencil or type in a word document, we need you to do it, and we need to bolster those who do just as much as those directly acting to protect the most vulnerable amongst us.\n\n  \nTicking a box once every four years won't save us. It's not useless, but it's just one small part of a much grander effort to fight back against the far-right's culture war. Make your voice loud and clear to rise above the loud bigots: If you are threatened by Fasicsts, you are safe with us!",

That's why I'm not just like \"I'm gonna go talk to X Y and Z and we'll start organizing the assembly!\"\n\nI'm just gonna start talking to people about the idea. Cuz.. so far no one else is doing it, and it clearly needs to get done. You don't have to be an anarchist to realize that.\n\nMy plan is to try to find nexus points in the neighborhood -- people who are connected to a lot of other people. Like bartenders is my first thought. Cafe and restaurant workers. Salon workers. I'm White, so I should probably prioritize anywhere with PoC workers.\n\nI think it'll be a pretty easy sell. People are really scared, and the best way to deal with fear, I think, is to prepare (and get people to know each other!!). People *want* something like this, even if they don't know it yet.\n\nOnce I get a few key people on board, I think it could pick up steam really quickly.\n\nFeel free to share feedback, constructive criticism or what you're doing instead of AFM!",

It happened in the UK but I'm also wondering if it happened in the US. The rise of the internet was happening around that time too so while many people may be blaming the internet and while the internet may be of contributing factor I'm wondering how much things like 9\/11 and the 2008 financial crisis also played a part and I took a look at the trustworthiness level the American people trusted the government over a period of time and I saw that there was a rise around around 9\/11 and then it just went down and it seemed like it never really recovered. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/politics\/2024\/06\/24\/public-trust-in-government-1958-2024\/\n\nAnd as you probably know things like recessions and financial instability create an opportunity for the rides in the far right.\n\nI'm just interested in your thoughts on this as well as wondering why people started distrusting around 9:11 because I thought that people would have been really excited about that because it was such gung-ho patriotism and nationalism and I thought people would have been very trusting of the government at the time but it seems like it almost immediately went down after the attack rather than going up first and then going down which is what I would have expected more.",

        "selftext":"I\u2019ve been thinking about the idea of anarchists working within government systems. Some argue that this is a way to \u201cpractice what they preach,\u201d but I see a contradiction that\u2019s worth addressing.\n\nAnarchy, at its core, is about rejecting hierarchical control, state authority, and the structures that uphold oppression. Governments exist to maintain power over people, and their systems are designed to sustain themselves, not to be dismantled from within. So when someone claims to be an anarchist while actively working in government, it raises an important question: **Are they truly practicing anarchist ideals, or are they just participating in the very system they claim to oppose?**\n\nNow, I understand that survival under capitalism requires compromise. Many of us take jobs within systems we don\u2019t fully align with because we need to pay bills, get healthcare, or navigate the reality we were born into. There\u2019s no shame in that. But let\u2019s be honest, there\u2019s a difference between working a job to survive and working for the government while claiming to resist it.\n\nIf your paycheck comes from an institution built on oppression, you\u2019re **reinforcing** that institution\u2019s existence, whether intentionally or not. You can believe you\u2019re making a difference, but real systemic change doesn\u2019t come from within systems designed to preserve themselves. Governments don\u2019t allow people to hold real power unless it serves their function. That\u2019s why historically, even well-intended reformists end up constrained by the structures they work within.\n\nWith the growing threats we\u2019re facing, environmental collapse, increased surveillance, rising authoritarianism, we don\u2019t need more people trying to \u201cfix\u201d a system that was never meant to serve us. We need more people turning their backs on it entirely. Saying no more to oppressive laws, exploitative labor, and a system that actively works against us. We spend so much of our time, energy, and resources feeding a machine that is trying to kill us. Imagine what could happen if that energy was redirected into something better.\n\nI\u2019m not telling people what to do, everyone has to make their own choices. But personally, I believe the future isn\u2019t in reforming or working within the system. It\u2019s in walking away from it. In creating something new, something prosperous, something that actually serves us. A world where we invest in each other, not in a dying system that was built to control us.\n\nWe all exist within oppressive systems, but how we engage with them matters. The question isn\u2019t just **what we do**, but ***why***, and whether our choices are truly moving us toward liberation, or just making it easier to exist within the system as it is.",

Someone came but it wasn't my mom. My real mom had killed rattlesnakes when I was a kid to protect us. One time, she sliced one into pieces with the blade of a shovel.But this imposter mom was worried about the snake's health. It used a roll of paper towels to gather the snake up. \"No,\" I complained, \"it'll bite you through the towel, what are you doing?! Why?!\" But she didn't listen. This was not my mom.  \n  \nShe took it out the front door and released the snake not ten feet from the door in some misguided catch-and-release nonsense. The snake rushed toward me and I woke up screaming.My therapist thinks the 'mom' in this dream was my perception of the DNC and oppositional establishment in the US. I agree. I am a politically disenfranchised person and only have one vote. I rely on broader civil society to protect me from discrimination and harm. They seem to have failed me, lately.My real mom just spoke to me today. She shared a dream she had on Wednesday. She dreamed of a giant Trump head in a MAGA hat attached to the body of a giant snake looming over her in darkness. At her side was a female family member, maybe me, maybe her sister, or my sister. My mom shouted \"GRAB A POLE!\" and together, she and the other woman started bashing the snake.  \n  \nMy mom said she saw the face's cheeks puff up and distort and then she realized that's where she had to strike. She smashed through it with the pole, describing it to me on the phone as 'that grisly resistance feeling you get when you cut through an animal' (I love my mother). Then the snake dissolved.  \n  \nWe then talked about meaningful action, and how the destruction of this evil has to come not from our American left, but the world, because if it comes from only us, they will continue to denounce and deflect and lie and claim conspiracy.  \n  \nThis is a global threat. And I love my mom.

        "selftext":"I think this technically fits here, this is a small portion on the complex field hyper-sanity that pertains to the ideals of anarchism.\n\nIf it doesn't fit please lemme know why as I'm still learning about anarchism in comparison.  \nI did this last year when I had more time to learn\/research.\n\nThink of hyper-sanity as a framework for perspectives, using consequential mechanics for outcomes, this isn't about inherent ethical frameworks - there's many ways it can be applied in practice, just like critical-thinking isn't inherently good\/bad, depends on how it's used.\n\n\n\nIf rules were never broken there'd never be growth or evolution, the secret in life that no-one will tell you is - which ones to break; and when.\n\nIn a world where conformity often feels like the safest path, rule-breaking is frequently viewed with suspicion. However, through the lens of hypersanity, rule-breaking emerges not as a reckless endeavor but as an essential catalyst for growth and transformation, both on a personal and societal level. This perspective asks us to rethink not just the necessity of rules but the very nature of why they exist and how they shape our experiences.\n\nThe reality is that not all rules are designed to nurture or protect. Many are relics of past circumstances, established in times that required stability or control. They may have been created by individuals who sought to maintain power or simply to preserve a tradition without questioning its present-day utility. Growth, then, requires the discernment to differentiate between those rules that foster development and those that impede progress. It calls for the courage to break those rules that have outlived their relevance and now serve as barriers rather than bridges.\n\nRule-breaking, therefore, becomes an act of liberation. It is a means of freeing ourselves from outdated paradigms that hinder progress, enabling us to step into new realities where personal and collective growth can thrive. The journey of questioning, challenging, and ultimately breaking certain rules is what allows society to evolve. This evolution is not about discarding all structures but about understanding which structures still serve us and which ones need transformation. Rule-breaking, when approached with wisdom and responsibility, is an exercise in conscious evolution\u2014an act that honors the potential for positive change.\n\n**Intelligent Rule-Breaking: Courage and Discernment**\n\nHypersanity involves a deeper insight\u2014a profound awareness that surpasses conventional definitions of sanity. In this state, one discerns which rules require breaking for growth. It is not about rebellion for rebellion's sake; it is about intentional action, driven by clarity and guided by a responsibility towards both oneself and society. Intelligent rule-breaking is thus an act of courage that comes with understanding the deeper purposes these rules serve or fail to serve.\n\nConsider\u00a0**scientific paradigms**: throughout history, some of the most groundbreaking scientific advancements have come from breaking away from established norms. Newton's laws once provided a comprehensive view of the physical world, but Einstein dared to question and expand upon them, ultimately reframing our understanding of physics. This type of rule-breaking wasn't rooted in a desire to dismantle the old, but rather to grow beyond its limitations, to find deeper truths that served humanity's evolving understanding of the universe.\n\nEinstein\u2019s work is a perfect example of how rule-breaking, when approached intelligently, leads to expansion. It required not only technical knowledge but also a deep awareness of where the existing framework fell short. Breaking away from Newtonian physics was not an act of destruction but one of creation\u2014ushering in new possibilities for how we perceive time, space, and gravity. It demonstrates that the true essence of intelligent rule-breaking lies in understanding where the old models limit us and how new models can bring a more accurate and complete understanding of reality.\n\nSimilarly,\u00a0**social norms and justice**\u00a0have seen profound shifts because individuals or movements challenged entrenched beliefs. The progress in civil rights, gender equality, and environmental protection has often come from a willingness to disregard the outdated norms that perpetuated injustice. It was not reckless rebellion but an intentional choice rooted in empathy and a vision for a more inclusive society. The courage to break these social \"rules\" is what drives meaningful transformation\u2014it paves the way for a better collective reality.\n\nMovements such as the Civil Rights Movement or the suffragette movement did not succeed simply because people were willing to break rules\u2014they succeeded because the individuals involved understood the broader implications of the norms they challenged. They recognized that these outdated rules served only to marginalize and divide. This kind of rule-breaking required a willingness to endure social disapproval, to risk personal safety, and to maintain a steadfast vision of a more just world. It required hypersanity\u2014a profound awareness that transcended the superficial sense of order, driven by a deeper understanding of what true justice and equality demanded.\n\nOn a\u00a0**personal level**, growth involves breaking the \"rules\" within ourselves\u2014rules shaped by our upbringing, past experiences, or society's influence. Many of these rules are internal boundaries that once served a protective role but now limit us. Hypersanity involves recognizing which of these rules are necessary boundaries, essential for well-being, and which are outdated beliefs that hinder personal evolution. Growth, in this sense, means dismantling those limiting beliefs with insight and replacing them with more expansive perspectives.\n\nWe are often taught rules about what is possible for us\u2014rules about our capabilities, our worth, and our potential. Many of these rules become internalized as limiting beliefs, and they restrict our ability to grow and explore new possibilities. Breaking these rules requires deep introspection, a willingness to face discomfort, and the courage to challenge our self-imposed limitations. It means seeing beyond the restrictions imposed by fear, past failures, or societal expectations, and embracing a version of ourselves that is continuously evolving. Hypersanity guides us to see that true personal growth involves not just self-improvement but the dismantling of internal constructs that keep us confined to a limited version of who we are.\n\n**The Wisdom to Break Selectively**\n\nThrough the hypersane lens, true wisdom lies in the ability to selectively break the rules that no longer serve us. It is a balanced approach that requires knowledge, foresight, and accountability. Rule-breaking, when done wisely, is not merely about the thrill of defiance; it is about transformation\u2014it is about understanding the intricate dance between what should be preserved and what must be dismantled to make way for something greater.\n\nThis selective practice demands both courage and awareness. It is a journey of acting in alignment with one's values, even when those actions defy the expectations or norms that surround us. Hypersanity provides the vision to see beyond the status quo, to understand the dynamics of power, control, and potential, and to act in ways that honor growth, connection, and truth.\n\nThe key is discernment\u2014knowing when breaking a rule will serve the greater good and when it may cause unnecessary harm. It is about acting from a place of awareness rather than ego. When we break rules in a hypersane manner, we are not motivated by the desire to prove ourselves right or superior. Instead, we are motivated by a deeper understanding of what needs to change for growth to occur. It is about bringing more authenticity, freedom, and depth to our lives and to the systems we are part of.\n\nBy cultivating the courage to break the rules that hold us back, we allow ourselves to engage in a dynamic and meaningful process of growth. This type of rule-breaking is inherently creative\u2014it involves not just rejecting old limitations but envisioning and building something better in their place. Through hypersanity, we gain the insight to know which boundaries are meant to be respected and which are meant to be transcended, leading us toward a life that is more expansive, liberated, and aligned with our highest values.\n\nUltimately, rule-breaking through the hypersane perspective is about honoring the potential for growth in all its forms. It is about trusting in our ability to discern wisely, to challenge courageously, and to evolve continuously. It reminds us that true progress\u2014whether personal, scientific, or societal\u2014depends on our willingness to question the old and dare to create the new.",

        "selftext":"For starters, I don't consider myself a leftist, I consider myself a revolutionary\/radical. The topic of censorship, expands beyond my criticism of the left, because censirship can happen with individual people, groups,anfd just overall it can be a societal problem. \n\nI'm no stranger to censorship, and critizing online spaces. The reason why censorship is problematic is because it doesn't allow for open discussion conversation and valid criticism of particular rhetoric\/ideologies, people\/groups\/societies can be so sensitive as not to allow such criticism of their beliefs and ideologies. I've encounterred censorship many times simply for giving honest opinions, or critique of certain views, and reddit as a platform is well known for its censorship habits, it can be irritating. \n\nCensorship for me is unappealing because it sends the message that people\/groups\/societieds are closed-minded, and  lack critical thinking. Censorship severely limits growth and critical thinking, and expansion on philosopical thinking. \n\nAnyways, I feel as though the left is pretty authoritarian, it's filled with authoritarian leftist that believe that \"State Socialism\" and \"State Communism\" is possible, when In the past revolutions with Russia and the soviet union\/USSR, and China with the CCP have failed, because these system reproduced State Capitalism. Simply by referring to these countries as Socialist or Communist isn't accurate to what Socialistm and Communism is defined as. \n\nSocialism is classified as workers having free association and ownership over the means of production and the abolition of the Capitalist class and their monopolization of the means of production and workers control.\n\nCommunism is defined as a Moneyless, Stateless and Classless society, none of which the USSR and the CCP have achieved, therefore they aren't Socialist or Communist, for many authoritarian leftist they have a visceral reaction to this criticism, which led to me being banned from the Sociallist reddit forum. Which is precisely why I criticize the left, and don't consider myself a leftist because of their authoritarian views with Statism, Socialism and Communism.\n\n\nWe can never move forward and make progress if we can't have opened minded discussion or people not being to sensitive with their ideology\/rhetoric. Censorship prevents this, and it precisely how it's supposed to function by suppressing free speech and having certain biases to the more conformist or favorable ideologies\/rhetoric. \n\nI believe it's an oxymoron, to say that a country can be Socialist or Communist, and operate in a Socialist and Communist ways. Countries serve the purpose of Nationalism, Statism, Imperialism, and Colonialism.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I made this post to critque the Authoritarian left and biased censorship, so if you're not an Authoritarian leftist this post isn't for you, and if you're not a biased moderator that censores people because they have different political opinions then these criticism are definitely not for you.\n\nI made this post based on my observations of Leftist spaces, not every reddit is the same, however im particular to Revolutionary\/Radical spaces, when it comes to expressong opinions, I believe it's okay to disagree without censorship, (that's what downvotes are for).\n\nThis post may seem controversial to some and maybe taboo and that's completely fine. But I'm mostly critiqing the Authoritarian left and biased moderators of Revolutionary\/Radical subreddits. \n\n ",

At the same time, I've often thought about what the ideal, utopian society would like. Or at least, what a society transitioning to that could look like. I've been paralyzed, because I've seen no path for me, other than as a naysayer, a complainer, a whiner, a critic.\n\nI've read a bit, and done some thinking on my own, and I've basically arrived at the conclusion that human beings are essentially organized into hierarchies and systems that are extremely messed up, with state power (at the national level) being the common enemy hanging over all our heads (as I think anyone on this sub might agree). \n\nI don't believe it's possible to attack the nation-states from the top-down and be \"stateless\" at any point in my my life. And I don't believe in an every-man-for-himself way of life either. I believe that full human potential is unlocked when we work in harmony with the Earth and with each other. Thus, some level of cooperation is necessary.\n\nI've been inspired by reading Bookchin, and by reading about \"sewer socialism\" and now believe that cities and towns may be a good place to start making serious changes to get people more engaged in democracy, in managing the little piece of Earth that we share, in figuring out how to share our limited resources, and so on.\n\nI am considering running for local office and want to bring along a vision for radical change based on some of Bookchin's ideas. I want to make democracy more inclusive. I want to emphasize quality of life over more standard economic indicators that the businessmen who usually sit in my local government champion.  I want our city to put the environment more at the forefront of every choice we make. I want to stop spending so much on police (I believe it should be everyone's long-term goal to abolish police or radically redefine what policing is; who wants to imagine a world where crime will always need to be fought by bullies with guns?)\n\nWhat do folks think of this vision?

        "selftext":"I keep an eye on this forum. However I see flaws in Revolutionary and Radical thought here. \n\nMost revolutionaries still have this ideal of a revolution being about Anarchist, Anticapitalist, Antiauthoritarians, overthrowing the system of State and Capitalism overnight through vanguard militarized action. When this is not only a power fantasy but it wouldn't be useful or effective on actually changing our material reality. It would only reproduced a Capitalist and Statist system.\n\nA revolution is a series of uprisings, resistances and revolts against current political system that exist which don't work or serve in favor of the masses. While we can't plan an Anarchist society, because it would be a finality, a revolution does take strong horizontal power structures and planning  and proper self-defense against Fascism and Statism. \n\nI feel as though it's easy to talk about revolution online and discuss theory, but it's takes more energy and effort to put in the praxis. For many people whether you're a radical or not, we often love the idea of community but lack motivation, energy or time commitment to craft the society we want to build, mostly due to a hyper individuallist society we already live under, we tend to pay attention more to our personal issues, which is valid. And revolutionary action isn't going to look the same for everyone, internationally we all deal with different varying degrees of oppression that need different solutions. When it comes to praxis there isn't a formula that fits everyone.\n\n\nIt's easy to be lazy in thinking and praxis about revolution especially for those that are already dealing with hyper individuallism and isolation. Which is my case as well. It's especially more of a challenge when there's a task of educating people on Anarchist views, the bedrock of revolution is people recognizeing their dialectic material conditions, learning about the oppressive institutions they must eradicate, and educating other people in the processes, forming mutal networks etc. However class consciousness, comes from societies having to experience the destructive natures of a system.\n\nIn the case of the American Empire it is in major decline and has been for decades, economic crisis, environmental crisis with climate change and illnesses, inflation, etc. it's an Empire that's in denial, and it's the working class that will suffer from the decline, not the Demagogues or the Capitalist. The problem is that many people still buy into the Electoral system every four years hoping for change because that's much easier than the effort of direct action for some. \n\nAnyway a bit of a rant, but I just find it weird and irritating how many people still have this belief that a revolution will happen overnight through militarized vanguard action when it's more complicated than that, and revolutionnary action isn't the same for all of us across the globe. I also find it extremely weird how some people believe the State will \"help\" in the  Anticapitalist and Antistatist revolution. History has shown that when there's any opposition that is a threat to the State that it will eliminate its opposition through force and coercion. ",

        "title":"We Are More Than Cogs; We Are the Revolution",
        "selftext":"For too long, we\u2019ve been fed a lie. A lie that we\u2019re free, that this system works for us, that if we just work hard enough, we\u2019ll achieve the dream. But look closer\u2014the dream is a mirage, designed to keep us chasing while they reap the rewards. The few, those at the top, have declared themselves gods, ruling over us as though they own not just the wealth but the very air we breathe.\n\nThe truth is harsh, but it must be said: we are nothing more than cogs in their machine, spinning endlessly to make the rich richer, the powerful more powerful. But if we can\u2019t live free, the system can\u2019t stand.\n\nWe\u2019ve been told that scarcity is the reason for our struggle. That there aren\u2019t enough resources, so we must compete, fight, and claw for scraps. But that\u2019s another lie. Think about this: there are over 333 million people in America alone\u2014and the reality is, we have the resources to stop the constant churn of mass production, to live sustainably, and still thrive. There\u2019s enough land, food, energy, and technology to create a society that ensures every single person\u2019s survival and dignity.\n\nSo why don\u2019t we? Because this system thrives on greed. Corporations would rather let food rot in warehouses than give it to the hungry. They\u2019d rather pollute rivers and destroy forests than lose a dollar of profit. They\u2019d rather exploit our personal data, manipulate us with marketing, and push endless consumerism than admit the truth: this isn\u2019t about meeting our needs; it\u2019s about feeding their power.\n\nThey sell us the illusion of choice while using psychological manipulation to control our desires. They\u2019ve turned our lives into commodities, our data into currency, and our labor into fuel for their machine. The system wasn\u2019t built to serve us\u2014it was built to enslave us. But our unity, their downfall.\n\nHistory shows us the truth. From the Gilded Age of robber barons to the billionaires of today, the system has always been rigged. Corporations crush workers to cut costs. Politicians sell their souls to the highest bidder. Wars are waged to protect profits, not people. Many voices, one movement is their greatest fear.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014they only win if we stay divided. They\u2019ve spent decades pitting us against each other. Left vs. right. Rural vs. urban. Black vs. white. It\u2019s a strategy straight out of Orwell\u2019s 1984. They want us too distracted fighting one another to see the real enemy. Because they know the truth: we are more than cogs in their machine; we are the revolution.\n\nThink about the power we hold. Together, we outnumber them a thousand to one. Together, we are unstoppable. They control the wealth, the media, and the laws, but none of that matters if we refuse to comply. If we unite, resist, and rebuild, we can create a system that works for all of us, not just the privileged few. The time is now: unite, resist, rebuild.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about tearing down their machine. It\u2019s about building something better. A future where no one is exploited for a paycheck, where no child goes hungry, where no voice is silenced because it challenges the status quo. It\u2019s about reclaiming the dream they\u2019ve stolen from us. Rise as one, reclaim the future.\n\nWe are done begging for scraps from their table. We\u2019re done watching as they strip our communities of opportunity while lining their pockets. We\u2019re done believing the lie that this is just the way things are. No gods, no masters\u2014only freedom.\n\nThey want you to feel small. Powerless. But remember this: their power comes from us. Every hour we work. Every dollar we spend. Every time we stay silent. Fight the few, empower the many. If we withdraw that power, their system crumbles.\n\nWe stand at a crossroads. On one side is the broken system they want us to accept. On the other is a future we can build together. A future where we\u2019re no longer cogs in their machine but the architects of our destiny. The choice is clear: their system, our power, one reckoning.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with the words of Thomas Jefferson: \"When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty.\"\n\nLet this be our duty. Let this be our spark. Let this be the moment we reclaim what is ours.\n\n",

        "selftext":"This is mostly a rant about my process of self discovery leading to anarchism. If you don\u2019t feel like reading a redditor\u2019s summarized ideological life story feel free to move on to another post. But thank you if you decide to stay. \n\nI am very happy to call myself an anarchist after several years of floating in the political limbo of not adhering strictly to an ideology. I grew up protestant in the US and from there I naturally became a good ol\u2019 american neoliberal, as I would have called myself a christian conservative when i was an older teenager. That didn\u2019t last too long as I only adhered to that ideology from growing up in that environment, but deep down I knew that wasn\u2019t really who I am even if i didn\u2019t realize that at first. \n\nA few existential crises later I was floating around in an ideological void after leaving american christianity behind, hanging out with my two new best friends who happen to be a tankie and an anarchist. How they are such close friends being so ideologically opposed in many ways is another interesting story entirely on its own. I began to realize i\u2019ve always had a pretty left leaning personality and values, but now i\u2019d fully get the chance to express them in their totality. But I had a choice to make. I was surrounded by auth communism along with anarchism at the same time, and I couldn\u2019t choose. I had convinced myself that \u201canarchy wouldn\u2019t work\u201d and that the auth commies had to be right. \u201cWho would run air traffic control in an anarchist commune?\u201d I thought. So I called myself a Marxist for a little while. It didn\u2019t stick. I kinda hated it actually. My body rebelled against the label. \n\nAnother year or so went by. And the answer ended up being a lot more simple than I ever would have thought: What do I want to live out as my own life and help welcome the world into? And that answer is anarchism. I don\u2019t like state power structures. I don\u2019t like vertical hierarchy. I hate oppression. There\u2019s hardly a worse feeling than the weight of authority upon one\u2019s being. I want every human being to have no one above them, no one below them. None be forced to bear the weight of nations. None be beaten down by the force of the state. \n\nOther answers followed from there. What\u2019s stopping us from running air traffic control? We don\u2019t have to have a hierarchy to do it. All it takes is action and coordination.\n\nA lot of ideas I had for a very long time have begun to click one after the other. Even when I was immersed in american protestantism I always disliked the power structures in church and school and wondered why we couldn\u2019t do things differently and actually be fair to each other and help each other. Like how some kids went without lunch cause they couldn\u2019t pay for it. I\u2019ve always thought money to be such a stupid concept. \n\nSo anarchism for me was a bit inevitable really. Wanting to dismantle hierarchy has always been in me. I hope I can find a place here on this subreddit and others like this one. If you\u2019ll have me, as a young anarchist, let\u2019s dismantle the structured world. ",

However, I didn't mention the crucial point of this unrest: the election fraud conspiracy theory, the result of right-wing populism and authoritarianism in our society. And that's why I'm explaining about South Korean right-wing populism and its \"election fraud\" to my comrades in Japan, Taiwan, HK, Tibet, Mongolia, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Papua, etc.\n\n1. Background\n\n[HK comrades teaching the cops a lesson with molotov cocktails](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q5pxzbcma5fe1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be1c982312691dbab55fe93bb357d8e3ccc17844)\n\nYes, we were all depressed when HK comrades, despite fighting valiantly, eventually knelt down to Chinese imperialism and authoritarianism. \n\nHowever, in South Korea, the situation was perceived a little differently.\n\n[Right over S. Korea is North Korea, and beyond it are China and Russia, two anti-West fascist \\(Dengist\\\/Putinist\\) regimes](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1yh4b97bb5fe1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e6486d246e255a81cf08d6c4758cd55e3542ae9)\n\nAs you know, South Korea has been always pro-West, while North Korea, along with China and USSR-&gt;Russia, have been mostly anti-West. Due to such reasons, the term \ubd81\uc911\ub7ec(NK-CN-RU) has been often used, and Korean right-wing, often seeing them as \"communist or ex-communist dictatorship regimes\", became extremely pro-West and Japanophile.\n\nTherefore, when HK protesters, who were British (pro-West) 23 years ago, lost to China, a \"communist\" (I mean state capitalist) anti-West country, South Koreans were extremely shocked, since it might be Korea's next future.\n\n[\\\\\"Jews are genetically inferior, but they are controlling all banks and corporations\\\\\" - Nazis](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vx6dilokc5fe1.png?width=1532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3d696da8d8ef415b3354306b03728513c44e6fe)\n\nThese anti-communist and anti-anti-West sentiments, combined with anti-Chinese racism (including anti-Korean-Chinese racism, since Korean Chinese are often seen as \"brainwashed Chinese who are no longer Korean\"), turned into the significant conspiracy theory.\n\n2. \"China Gate\"\n\n[The first of all](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9hidhigwe5fe1.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adee6f7170193560e17447f2454d1cb1785ec54f)\n\nIn 2020, when [the legislative election](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2020_South_Korean_legislative_election) was coming soon, a right-wing user, who insisted that he is a Korean Chinese, said that liberals are Chinese proxies and pro-liberal, pro-Chinese\/pro-NK, anti-Japanese\/anti-USA, and anti-conservative replies and tweets are written by Chinese agents. \n\nAccording to this writing, many internet users discovered the \"suspicious activities\", and believed that pro-liberal opinions on Internet are dominated by Chinese agents, and that the election will prove it.\n\nHowever, the result was: liberals taking more than 180 seats out of 300, while conservatives barely covering about 105 seats.\n\n3. Result denial\n\n[\\\\\"2020 legislative election was a hoax\\\\\" \\\\\"Scanned the voting papers, and printed them again\\\\\" \\\\\"Not punishing the election fraud leads our country to destruction\\\\\" -\uc625\uc740\ud638 \\(Ok Un-Ho\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4o6kmw3pg5fe1.png?width=185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9904829837290c3b586c8c7673a1e9103e093746)\n\nDue to cognitive dissonance, many right-wing populists started believing one thing: they won, but due to Chinese manipulation, they lost.\n\nDespite the government and journals repeatedly arguing against such conspiracy theory, it still remained popular toward senior evangelicals and anti-communists.\n\nHopefully, the election of conservative Yoon Suk-Yeol seemed to resolve the conspiracy theory.\n\n4. Resurrection\n\n[\\\\\"The chaos of ROK... was invoked by Election Commission!\\\\\" - \uc804\ud55c\uae38\\(Jeon Han-Gil\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kzkd4d4hh5fe1.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce2cae9aba8f80ea3e0db36355fbd93ee4d297cc)\n\nYoon Suk-Yeol himself turned to believe such theory - according to former centrals, he[ said](https:\/\/weekly.chosun.com\/news\/articleView.html?idxno=38819) \"My election was kinda weird too. I should have won the liberal in distance of 10\\~15%p, but it was mere 0.73%p. How?\".\n\nAnd, it turned out that, Yoon's (as well as martial law forces') primary object was investigating the Election Commission, and \"persuading\" the officials and politicians to confess that there were election frauds.\n\nYoon Suk-Yeol himself insisted that the country was \"in serious problem\" due to Chinese election intervention, and that was why he declared martial law to \"fix\" the problem.\n\nThe propangadized pro-Yoon protesters, now including not only evangelicals, anti-communists, and Mccathists but also alt-rights, xenophobes\/Islamophobes, and homophobes, started chanting \"stop election fraud\",[ reporting pro-liberal entertainers to CIA and M16](https:\/\/n.news.naver.com\/mnews\/article\/088\/0000921367?sid=102), and even rioting in the court.\n\n5. Conclusion + opinion\n\nAs you learned through this article, right-wing populism, fueled with Mccarthyism and authoritarianism, is trying to deny the reality. This ironically emphasizes the importance of fact-checking in our activities.\n\nKeep these lessons in mind, comrades in Japan, Taiwan, HK, Tibet, Mongolia, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Papua, the USA, Canada, Mexico, Ukraine, Greece, Russia, Belarus, Germany, France, the UK, Romania, Hungary, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, Cyprus, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kurdistan, Bethnahrain\/Mesopotamia, Balochistan, Tajikistan, Pashtunistan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Circassia, Chechnya, Jordan, Jewish and Arab Palestine, Western Sahara, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, South Africa, etc. Thanks for reading.",

I don't mean to sound dismissive or jaded, it's just that at nearly 30 this isn't my first rodeo, but I am feeling very small and very ineffective this time around. \n\nI live in the deep south, one of those \"blue dots in a sea of red\" type cities. It likes to project itself as progressively-minded, but it's just very status-quo liberal. Still I was able to connect with some more radical folks out here (there aren't many!) and it felt like there was hope for forging community and strong connections and doing good work. \n\nBut I ended up having really terrible experiences with local community organizing efforts. The most upsetting was with an anarchist group that I worked with for about a year, which ultimately kicked me out of the organizing space for being lgbtq and neurodivergent -- in their words, it made things 'awkward' and made other people 'uncomfortable'. Then proceeded to steal from me and threaten violence against me. \n\nI moved on to other projects and groups but they all fell apart. One project that really felt like it was going to make a difference ended up selling out for corporate funding and threw its principles under the bus. Other groups and organizations lost steam and membership as folks moved away or lost interest, and eventually folded their chapters. And others, that ableist\/transphobic anarchist group ended up taking over. \n\nFor awhile some of us tried to start our own community group &amp; independent projects. But the oft-given advice, \"Just organize the community\/set up mutual aid networks\/do the projects yourself!\" is so much harder than it sounds in practice. We realized we didn't have a lot of experience under our belts but \"organizing veterans\" we appealed to for guidance were burnt out and wanted nothing to do with any more of it. So we just gave it our best try, and I know the idea is that if you set an example folks will see and become involved, but that isn't what happened. Definitionally, this isn't work that can be done by yourself or with just 2 or 3 people. The logistics aren't possible. We didn't do a damn bit of good, but we sure exhausted ourselves spinning our tires in the mud. \n\nGet involved. Get organized. Make a difference. Don't look away. Don't choose inaction. I've tried and I've failed. I'm not in a position where I can support anything financially. I don't have the experience, the knowledge, or skills to found something new from the ground up. I'm trying not to be just another burnt-out, jaded old timer. I'm trying not to be defeatist or apathetic. I still try to do what little I can, but it's not enough. Where do you go from here? ",

Keep posting on it comrades! Maybe someone of us can think that a media is \u201cfree\u201d but other comrade can have info against this assert. So lets keep calm, lets discuss with serenity and construct this list toghether. But first of all lets discuss what is a \u201cFree Media\u201d. Here my suggestions:\n\nWith free media I mean:\n\nA must:\n\n1.- Are not accepting money directly from a bank, think tanks, political parties or capitalist groups (insurances, weapon industry,\u2026). A big income must be by suscription or ethical advertisements.\n\n2.- Can be public or private but not accepting interference of politicians. Can accept goverment advertising but without being the main income.\n\n3.- Journalists inside can be working full-time, part-time or freelancing. They must receive a decent salary far from the Interprofessional Minimum Wage and that allows them to live where they live in a dignified and self-sufficient manner.\n\n4.- They correct mistakes they have made publicly.\n\n5.- THEY SUPPORT FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND INFORMATION AND THEY WILL HELP EVEN TO THEIR COMPETENCE IN SUCH PROBLEMS.\n\n6.- Support and accepting material from local journalist or freelances on the ground. Paying them well for that (Video, Photo and Writers).\n\n7.- Once per year (minimun) they show their incomes and also salaries of the workers (but not the names for privacy). They dont especulate with their money.\n\n8.- Not using  \u201cclickbait\u201d titles and subtitles. \n\nA desirable:\n\n1.- Using free software or at least MIT license for their webpage or blog. \n2.- Not using fascists social networks like Meta, X, Google.\n3.- Not selling information of the suscribers to any third party business.\n4.- Using Creative Commons licenses.\n\nI know that is difficult right now to have all the criterias ticked but let\u00b4s mark the most \u201cfree media\u201d collaborating in this subreddit. Fo example: XXXXX media has 6,3 (means that they have 6 big ticks and 3 little ticks).\n\nPLEASE HELP PEOPLE KNOWING FROM WHERE THEY ARE INFORMING.\n\nOsasuna eta anarkia. \n",

        "selftext":"\n\nHello comrades! As a classic white-collar worker for the past 3+ years (working in the digital marketing industry), I've developed a huge theoretical interest in the techniques of compliance, manipulation, and control in the workplace under neoliberal capitalism. Techniques that, unfortunately, many employees fall for without even recognizing them as attempts of manipulation and compliance.\n\nBelow, I\u2019m sharing a list of such techniques and I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts:\n\n- Meetings (especially daily or very frequent ones): Corporate meetings are always hierarchical; you're \"assigned\" to speak by someone else (or you never speak at all as an employee). They serve as a method of enforcing compliance with corporate \"processes\" and are also a means of reinforcing hierarchies and controlling your workload and daily tasks (they're afraid of time theft).\n\n- Lunch and Learn: In some companies, free meals are offered with the condition that employees attend corporate brainwashing sessions during their break about \"how awesome we are as a company.\"\n\n- \"The company as a family\": The tired old clich\u00e9 that \"we are a family here\" attempts an emotional blackmail strategy, aiming to make employees \"feel obligated\" to go the extra mile for their \"family\" (e.g., unpaid overtime).\n\n- Employee surveillance tools: A classic and extremely invasive control practice under the guise of \"enhancing productivity.\"\n\n- Pizza Fridays, after-work drinks, and other social bonding events: These so-called \"job perks\" that many consider \"cool\" are actually distractions from meaningful raises, improved working conditions, etc. They also serve as a compliance and submission tool to the company\u2019s doctrine (e.g., if an employee repeatedly skips such events, they are demonized, ridiculed, and ostracized).\n\n- Managers and HR: Managers are not part of the working class; they belong to a different class (PMC - Professional Managerial Class). They monitor you, assign tasks, reprimand, fire you, etc. Essentially, they are the bosses' watchdogs within the workplace. HR exists solely to protect the company's interests\u2014they don\u2019t care about employees at all.\n\nApologies for my lousy English, but I would really love to discover more of these techniques so I can recognize them better from now on. Feel free to share your insights, suggest relevant books\/articles, etc.\n\nThanks for your time!",

        "selftext":"Currently reading a paper titled \"[Anarchism and Psychoanalysis](https:\/\/research.gold.ac.uk\/id\/eprint\/19401\/2\/AnarchismandPsychoanalysis.pdf)\" by Saul Newman. I don't know much about the guy, but the essay has been well-written and it's obviously well-researched and also obvious Newman has a fair amount of knowledge about both subjects so I'm taking it as a serious work. \n\nI'm not finished yet so it's possible he's going to tell me what he thinks the answer is, but I'd like to have a discussion about what perhaps you all believe the answer is. \n\n**So, the question:** In the world of an anarchist (in our current world or perhaps after a successful revolution) who\/what would take on the role of the \"primal father\" as defined by Freud. Here is a quote from the essay describing the concept, \"the primal father\u2014the ultimate and original patriarch\u2014has absolute power over his sons and demands from them devotion and obedience. The sons fear the primal father equally, thus creating a bond and sense of equality and community between them.\"\n\nHere is how I'm viewing the situation: For anarchists, the primal father is the State. But I think that's only the most obvious answer and perhaps others have more interesting interpretations. \n\nThe quote above is followed by this, \"However, as the father\u2014the archetypal absolute sovereign\u2014enjoys unrestricted access to all the women of tribe, prohibiting it to the sons, the sons band together to kill and devour the father. Yet, so the myth goes, this ultimate transgression creates a sense of collective guilt amongst the sons, and thus the law against incest arises. I will return to this later, as it has important consequences for this discussion: ***the removal of one form of prohibition does not necessarily free us as internalized constraints come to the fore to take its place.***\"\n\nDoes that change your answer? It's made me think twice about mine, but I can't come up with another off the top of my head. \n\n",

        "title":"Reclaiming Neo-Luddism from the Technophobes.",
        "selftext":"When I see the term Neo-Luddite online, I often see people like Ted Kaczynski brought up. Technophobes, rather than the Techno-Skepticist that make up the majority of the decentralized movement, just like how the original Luddites were painted as anti-technology when they were really just opposed to the centralization of industry and its place over their lives. I just want to state that I am not against tech. I love technology, I love computers, I love the internet, I love video games. As a millennial, these were my childhood. If you knew me irl, you might think I was a Retro-Tech fetishist. Someone who is obsessed with Web 1.0 and the aesthetics of the 2000s. While that is true, I have my reasons:\n\nThe current state of technology is that of classism, militarism, surveillance and exploitation of resources, labor and the environment. I am not fine with tech being used in such ways, and that as Anarchists we must stand by our morals and search for a way to undermine it. Here are a few things I propose for other Techno-Skeptics\/Neo-Luddites:\n\n* Minimalist Tech: Buy an MP3 player or a higher end DAP if you need it, learn how to torrent and or just rip the tracks off of your own CDs. Prioritize dumb devices that have specific usages over smart devices fhat have connections to the internet. Smartphone is your worst enemy, it is a distraction, a surveillance camera and a tool of psychological manipulation. I would suggest buying burners or flip phones over high end products like Iphone or Galaxy too. Buy a handheld console that boots roms. Stuff like that. Dont use streaming services, don't pay unless you are paying to support the development of the media, or to own the data forever.\n* Digital Minimalism: (This somewhat ties into the Minimalist tech but I thought I would make its own section) Limit the time you spend on devices. This doesn't exactly mean spend less time on digital devices, especially if thats your job or outlet for activism, you might want to, but to use them with intent. Limit your devices that are connected to the internet, have a singular device that is for using the internet. The internet is an extremely powerful tool for activism, spreading awareness, sharing media and opinions, but it can be a double edged sword when going in blind, and or if you are vulnerable to their manipulation, such as if you are a gambling addict, shopping addict, etc. Breaking yourself from that connection that these corporations have over your attention is key.\n* Software Minimalism and Modular Design: These are core tenets of the Unix Philosophy. Supporting, using or creating simple, efficient and accessible software. A focus in smaller file sizes, less resource intensiveness and ease of use is a way to democratize data and to make it more widely available to the general public. The smaller the file, the less incentive you have to delete it. The easier the code, the easier it is to modify, to innovate and to learn from. The more widely utilizable it will be. For example, take video games. People in both First and Third World countries can play games like Minecraft together more easily they can play Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 together, and it will have more longevity and improvements as a result of its ability to be customized and played in almost any device.\n* Embrace and host Third Spaces on the Internet: There needs to be places away from Capitalist interest online. There is a big attack on our freedom of speech with the Tik Tok ban, on apps like Twitter, as well as Facebook. Hell, Reddit is most likely a psyop. Whilst these can be good tools for outreach in specific instances, they should not be your primary method of interacting with the internet or communication as they are multibillion dollar companies, companies who do not have your best interest at heart, as they have proven time and time again. They steal your data, they manipulate your perception, they utilize algorithms to control the stream of information. Not good. I would suggest sites like SPACEHEY (a Myspace clone that allows you to customize your profile with html graphics, music players, etc. It only takes donations and sells merch. Thats it. Free to use.) MASTADON (A decentralized Twitter clone that hosts multiple smaller servers rather than just one) DISCORD (A server hosting site where you can set up your own servers that have chat channels, voice channels, you can stream, etc) TELEGRAM (A free encrypted messsging app that allows you to create group channels and share up to 1gb filesize. Great for hosting books, information or just talking) or SUBSTACK (a site that allows to write and share articles). Or hell, make your own site. I'll be the first person on your message board.\n\nAnyways, Ill end it here for sake of my thumbs. I am really passionate about this topic and I thank you for reading all the way through. I hope you all enjoy your day!  If you have any thoughts, or something you want to add, lmk.",

        "title":"Alexander Atabekian's Anarchist Communism",
        "selftext":"Alexander Atabekian was an Armenian Anarcho-Communist. He lived near the same time as the Russian Revolution and much of his writing makes reference to it. He liked Kropotkin in particular\n\nI initially wrote off Alexander Atabekian for some reason. I think it's because I started with his essay on \"territoriality,\" which was not the best place to start, and doesn't seem reflective of his larger body of work. If he had any larger works, they're not on the anarchist library, but what is there is succinct and echoes other \"classicals\" with a lucidity that I wasn't expecting\n\nI've never heard Atabekian's name come up in any anarchist discussion. I guess it would make sense if he didn't write that much, but I've heard Reclus name. He didn't write much either I don't think, besides the geography. So here is some stuff Atabekian wrote, which I liked. I will link each piece to each piece. They're all very short\n\nMore than once Atabekian uses \"power\" and \"authority\" interchangeably, as I think someone like Louise Michel does. He will also occasionally make reference to \"moral authority\". I believe this is a figure of speech however, maybe similar in his diction to \"confidence\". He will just as or more often repudiate authority in its entirety, and lays out clearly, with direct reference to right, a conceptualization of the latter that seems to easily fall within the authority held in contempt by other anarchists\n\n&gt; What characterises anarchism, what is common to all anarchists, whatever their starting point and way of thinking, is the rejection of authority, the denial of the right of people to forcibly subjugate other people, even if the power comes from a numerical majority. Diderot formulated this thought in the following words: \u201cNature has created neither masters nor servants; I want neither to make nor to receive laws\u201d.\n\n-[The Old and New in Anarchism](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-the-old-and-new-in-anarchism)\n\n\nTangentially, he has a second and uncompromising repudiation of democracy, up to and including \"direct legislation\".\n\n&gt; By its other basic property, the free association of individuals, with the right of each of them to withdraw from the association at any time, co-operation excludes coercion. Being free and voluntary in its internal construction, co-operation is hostile to external violence, which is an inevitable property of state power. Politically, co-operation can be neither monarchical, nor republican, nor democratic (as V. Kilchevsky claims), nor Soviet, since coercion is inherent in all power. Even under the most ideal state system, under direct popular legislation of property equal people, the majority subordinates the minority to its will. \n\n-[Co-operation and Anarchism](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-co-operation-and-anarchism)\n\nHe talked about Bolshevism a lot. He didn't like it. His critique of \"class struggle\" particularly as it was understood and exercised by the Bolsheviks I found resonant\n\n&gt; Thus capital, from the largest to the smallest amounts, are closely woven into the process of production, exchange and distribution of products. The class of capitalists is diffused throughout society and it is not possible to single it out into a separate class.\n\n&gt; Class struggle is the frozen dogma of the faith of all socialists and even of many anarchists. The terrible consequences of the widespread dissemination and application of this scientifically untenable theory in the ignorant masses of the Russian people, we have seen and experienced since the February Revolution, especially after the triumph of the direct heirs of the International \u2014 the Social-Democrats (Bolsheviks), in close contact (for the first time in history) with their co- heirs \u2014 the anarchists.\n\n&gt; After the October coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, which became so bloody thanks to the exaltation instilled by this theory, the \u201cbourgeois\u201d began to be searched for. But the search was in vain. The crimes of capitalism were in plain sight, but the criminal himself was elusive. It turned out that the bourgeoisie, as a class of people, had been absorbed into the middle, and even partly into the lower strata of the population. It was possible to point to some individual rich people, but even those have long since disappeared\u2026 They continued to look for the bourgeoisie, and in Moscow they found it in the person of Osip Minor, who had grown old because of his struggle for socialism in prisons and penal servitude, and his comrades in the party, in the person of the revolutionary officers and that part of the student youth which had rallied round the party of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, while the other part had joined the Bolsheviks. And nightmarish events took place, fraternal blood was shed on both sides in glorification of the new dogma of the faith of the ignorant people \u2014 the class struggle. This dogma awakened the spirit of fanaticism dormant in every ignorant man. And the darkest times of religious persecution were resurrected..\u2026\n\n-[The Old and New in Anarchism](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-the-old-and-new-in-anarchism)\n\nA very Kropotkin-y line here, I believe part of this might be a direct quote \n\n&gt; anarchy is above all the freedom of the individual, bounded only by the equal freedom of another individual, whoever he may be by conviction; it is natural morality without sanction or compulsion.\n\n-[Questions of Theory and Practice](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-questions-of-theory-and-practice)\n\n\nAnti-coercion is a big part of his project, which I agree with less, but I do find parts of it enchanting\n\n&gt; The anarchist who raises his hand to search another person, even if only for weapons, is no longer a proud ideological anarchist; he is lower than the last policeman; at least he does not hide behind the banner of freedom. The anarchist who crosses the threshold of another\u2019s dwelling to search it, even if only again for weapons, is a criminal against the high and pure doctrine which our ideological opponents consider unattainable.\n\n-[Questions of Theory and Practice](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-questions-of-theory-and-practice)\n\nSo provided Atabekian's uncompromising anti-authority anarchy, I see a complication of anarchism's ideological commitments that seems like it echoes through other places. It is the ground floor for his anarchism, opposing authority as a path to liberty and things of that nature\n\nThere are more pieces, some on organization. His talk here is similarly eloquent. He talks much about approaching anarchy as science, and speaks of trouble with anarchist \"congresses\" that couldn't bind their members, and otherwise became fraught with disintegration and new authorities. Insofar as anarchy is science, for Alexander Atabekian, this is no problem, because a conference is not where those decisions are made; organization is concerned principally with what is possible - external constraints, rather than consensus, the decision-making of majorities, etc.., and I think too a thread of individual works coalescing into collective action\n\n&gt; Just as the scientific congresses contributed little to science, because no binding resolutions were possible and science develops and grows through painstaking laboratory and office work, so too the anarchist congresses gave the comrades who came together an opportunity for personal communication and exchange of opinions, but that was all; they played no organisational role. The modern anarchist movement has grown and consolidated in its original groups.\n\n-[Questions of Theory and Practice](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-questions-of-theory-and-practice)\n\n&gt; We are not talking about other inconveniences of the central organization. Let\u2019s just say that a large part of the Armenian revolutionaries experienced the destructive and harmful influence of that \u201ccenter\u201d on their skin and was forced to withdraw from that idea. If until now those \u201ccenters\u201d have not finally destroyed the cause, the reason is that the cause itself is an essential, organic demand for the people and continues outside the centers, independently of them and often against all of them.\n\n&gt; \u201cSo, in your opinion,\u201d they answer us, \u201cthe general organization of the revolutionary force is impossible?\u201d Not at all. The only thing that follows from what we have said is that we need to look for other means and forms of organization \u2014 that we should not work in vain efforts and in vain time to form a unity of Yanun activity, but we must work with all our strength for the Yanun revolution, from which itself gave birth to a union and a permanent organization.\n\n&gt; ...activity, life develops a common plan of action for Armenian revolutionaries, then the place of current theoretical disputes will be replaced by a practical solidarity among various perfectly independent groups, none of which will try to impose either its principles or its tactics on the heads of others, and only then will we have a true organization \u2014 an organization that will arise from vital conditions, from the efforts made \u2014 an organization that will be based on the direct and close relations of the working groups.\n\n-[Revolutionary Organization](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-revolutionary-organization)\n\nSome of his writing was on World War I. In \"The Problem of a Free Army,\" he says that he worked as a doctor for two years in the Russian Army. His description of the way wartime economics undermined capitalism is very interesting, I don't know if it's more wholly his or if he derives this from somewhere \n\n&gt; The world war destroyed the foundations of the capitalist economy, while the October revolution continues its work and destroys the very forms of the capitalist system.\n\n&gt; War, that factor of discord, oppression and destruction, this time became fruitful and constructive. This was because, in its unprecedented size and duration, it shook up the entire economic life of the globe. It became a literal war of nations and subjugated all strata of society to its equalizing demands.\n\n&gt; It has barely disguised the extensive expropriations of private property by the name of requisitions; it has destroyed free trade by fixing prices; it has sought to equalise all strata of the\npopulation by food organisations for the equal distribution of essential foodstuffs. In short, the foundations of the capitalist system have been struck blow by blow, and this not only in our own country, but to an even greater extent in central and western Europe. The stronghold of class divisions, governmental power, has so far survived, but even in it large holes have been punctured.\n\n&gt; This unification of all strata of society in Western Europe has already begun to bear fruit, it is rebuilding the social order on new principles more methodically and firmly than we have in Russia; this reorganisation of the social order of the West is pointed out by Kropotkin in his \u201cLetters on Current Events\u201d, and only due to poor knowledge, due to the conditions of wartime, we can not take a closer look at this creative side of life in Europe, caused by the current war. In Russia, this association emerged and blossomed in the direction of social construction in the early years of the war. It found a wide field of practical application, rich material and useful experience in the activities of the All-Russian Zemsky Union and other public organisations. The business of organising aid to millions of refugees \u2014 to whole nations \u2014 became a school of practical socialism. Then the activity of public organisations spread to the greatest part of the population. It was their fruitful activity that created our food organisations and developed the initial technique of supplying and distributing foodstuffs.\n\n-The Old and New\n\nI thought his accusation specifically of the way authoritarian organization undermined the Russian army's capacity to fight was interesting too. Reminiscent of Bakunin, who theorized that authority is caustic to expertise (which Alexander Atabekian proposes that he witnessed in practice). I do not know if this is grounded in good history, but his perspective is neat\n\n&gt; After the February Revolution, which was to change the whole way of social life in the whole country, it was clear to everyone that the army could not retain its old forms. It, too, had to be renewed. What did the scientifically educated officers, as a professional category, do to point out to the broad layers of the people and the soldiering masses the right ways for renewal? Exactly nothing. We had officers with solid scientific knowledge and combat experience, but we had no officers. There was no purely professional spirit of association among our officers, standing beyond and above political and social beliefs and views. The army was led not by united professional workers, but by disparate officials appointed at the discretion of their superiors from above. This is what ruined the army in the first place.\n\n&gt; The truth is that we did not have a purely professional association of officers on the basis of technical knowledge, which would have enjoyed moral authority and would have been able to take into its own hands the work of army renewal from the very beginning. Our officers in the general mass, without initiative, without social outlook, with their thinking squeezed into the deadening framework of routine, were not capable of taking the lead in the reorganisation of the army on new principles, and by habit became inert, waiting for orders from above or clinging to the decaying old forms. From above came the political agitators, driven by the phantoms of the old power. From above came demagogues, chasing themselves after the power that intoxicates man. The results \u2014 we have read them in the Brest peace treaty and are reading them in Mirbach\u2019s notes.\n\n&gt; From this point of view, any anarchist-revolutionary \u2014 for defensive war is essentially an organised revolution against external state oppressors \u2014 can only welcome the initiative of \u201cMilitary Affairs\u201d. It is high time to make military affairs purely professional, to transfer them to the healthy ground of \u201cknowledge and skill\u201d instead of \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d and \u201cI obey!\u201d before the state power.\n\n&gt; Authority can call any accumulation of people an \u201carmy,\u201d such as the \u201cRed Army,\u201d but it cannot make it an army.\n\n-[The Problem of a Free Army](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-the-problem-of-a-free-army)\n\nWith regards to \"Territoriality and Anarchism\" I have mixed feelings, because I think there is an interesting point at the center of the work (given a certain tendency to view humans and environments and \"organistic\" to each other, although I do not know if that's a misapplication of Proudhon's unity-collectivity). \n\n&gt; If we look closely at the life of individual animal families and their societies, we will notice that each of them uses a certain place of residence \u2014 nest, burrow, den, anthill, beehive \u2014 and a relatively limited space of land, i.e. the territory on which it harvests the means for its own existence and for the preservation of the species (offspring). Even migratory birds, and those at different times of the year, return to their former home and old nest. The same is observed in nomadic tribes, which do not wander around the world wherever they see fit, but have their own definite kyshlagi and eylagi (as nomadic Tatars call the places of their winter and summer stay).\n\n&gt; The connection with the homeland is so strong in man that even with the modern extraordinary development of communication routes, people are very reluctant to move from their homeland, and then only under the pressure of irresistible economic necessity.\n\n&gt; Anarchism has so far put forward the territorial homeland \u2014 the commune \u2014 as its closest political ideal, because it was easier to imagine and realise a just social order there. But doom inevitably awaits the commune in a surrounding, hostile environment, as happened to Paris in 1871. In order to establish itself, anarchism must develop forms of organisation of large defensible units and then unite other countries more and more closely with its cultural influence. This is the direction in which the revival of the Anarchist International must be sought.\n\n-[Territoriality and Anarchism](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-atabekian-territoriality-and-anarchism)\n\nI'm unsure about his usage of \"commune\" as a territorial homeland, however now with the additional context of his other work I'm also not sure if he's using this in any particular national sense. I don't think he is. It almost seems like the essay is less about territoriality and more concerned with addressing the divide created by WW1 between \"anti-militarist\" anarchists and anarchists who supported the Entente. His point basically seems to be that neither option makes sense and that when an *anarchist* \"homeland\" is created (a \"homeland\" within his concept being any locality where they live and are organized towards) there's a coherent basis for attacking -archic forces that want to assimilate it. This seems like an unobjectionable position\n\nThere's some other things of his I haven't read, and I will now. I feel comfortable keeping his work in my back pocket as a \"starting point\" for most people, as much of this seems pure anarchism and not strictly anarcho-communism. His collection of ideas seems like ittouches a lot of important bases and does it in an easily readable way\n\nTwo last quotes that seem to wrap it up\n\n&gt; Theoretical anarchism is a science; its practice must become an applied science.\n\n&gt; You have to act to organize. Action, constant action \u2014 this is the only way to organization.",

        "selftext":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/s\/QbXFufJC2R\n\nHi so first off this is a follow-up to the post I already made on here. Second, this is mostly just to bring in discussions and talk and stuff. I'm not trying to change the world with a Reddit post. \n\nSo if you don't know about the FreeLM sub I think at first I was feeling like it was unfair and I think in some ways while I do find that it's somewhat unfair I think I didn't remember at the time what happens when a revolutionary person (and I'm not saying or not saying LM is politically revolutionary) that they're real politics become watered down. We see this with MLK for example, he's not seen as a black socialist, he's seen as the guy that made a speech one time about having a dream and that's all he is for many people. My mom who's a trump supporter seems to think that he would have been a conservative. In some ways I think that Tort got a better position than most. I mean they did get a Wikipedia page hehe. Whatever that even means for some people but my point is is that they were well known enough to hit somewhat mainstream eyes. If you type in their name on Reddit you'll see that a few communities were talking about them. I was talking to someone who is from Puerto Rico and is currently living on the mainland and he says that he heard of Tort as well although at the time they didn't really know the details of the situation. I think at the time I wanted Tort to get more attention but now I realize that that's not always the good thing because not all attention is good attention. Especially when it's a weird parasocial relationship attention where all of your baby pictures are posted stuff even when there is so far no evidence LM is guilty and the nature and conclusion of the trial does not prove without a shadow of a doubt. It just means that he is either labeled guilty or not guilty by the courts. Innocent people do get charged sometimes. It kind of reminds me of the true crime community where you have the people who are trying to treat it very seriously and be like sort of amateur detectives and tried to actually come to somewhat logical conclusions from the information that they have and then the people who post flower crowns of the shooters. \n\nAgain I'm not trying to move mountains with a Reddit post, more just curious about what other people might say in creating a sort of interesting discussion.\n\nEspecially in the topics of the liberalization of radical figures, parasocial relationships with people who are incarcerated, who are in court, or even just people who have gone down in history as doing something horrible. And also sort of the nature of privacy when you are someone who is seen as a martyr. Like I almost can't help but feel like there might be some sort of feeling of entitlement or something as if another person's entire life or history is just public domain now that person is essentially a public figure Martyr.

I'd love to see a re-telling where the rich person realizes how sheltered their life has been and how blind they were to the suffering of the poor, and realizes they and other rich folk have benefitted from this injustice. While the poor person realizes that high society life is stricter then they could have ever imagined, and NOT as sophisticated as they thought.\n\nThen, both team up to topple the system and ensure a truly or at least MASSIVELY more egalitarian society.

        "selftext":"**TL;DR:**\u00a0Thoughts on how to react to cuts to governmental spending? Especially when they target more socialist policies that largely benefit the working class.\n\n**Context:**\n\nHey all. I recently watched a few videos about how the conservative party wihtin the UK has effectively destroyed their nation in the name of budget cuts, among various other actions. Within America, we are about to have Trump take office where his cronies, in the form of DOGE (the name is an eyeroll), are planning on heavily slashing government spending, destroying many agencies in the process.\n\nThe anarchist position (based) is to eventually have a complete abolition of the state (and of capitalism as well).\n\n**My Thoughts:**\n\nIt seems like many of these cuts are to bring us to a more minarchist state, which is to say, gutting everything in the government except for the most controllling and powerful aspects of the state. These aspects being the police, prisons\/courts and military, which are, of course, the most vicious aspects of state.\n\nI don't feel like there's anything to cheer about with these governmental cuts, since it seems like many of them occur at the expense of the poor, working class, middle class and elderly individuals, while retaining the worst asepcts of the state. So how to progress?\n\n**Steps to follow (?):**\n\n1. We should vote and fight for liberal\/labour policies that maintain government spending (not that I'm a \"go out and vote!!!! liberal or anything) for public services that benefit society as a whole, specifically the working class.\n2. At the same time, we continue to target the most blatant uses of state power (police, prison\/courts and military) via actions and movements like defund the police and get rid of for-profit prisons etc. At the same time, we continue to target corporations and focus on unionization\/syndicalist efforts, alongside engaging in agorist black markets, creating communes, working to force corporations to increase pay, bring back pensions and any other activity to undermine the power of capitalists - I'm open to suggestions ;)\n\n**Outcome of Steps:**\n\nAttacking the more powerful forms of state control (police, prisons\/courts and military), will reduce the most blatant and brutal forms of state power, reducing the fear that can come from dissenting. This reduction in power will be double important for when the nearly inevitable rush to fascism occurs in response to a growing leftist sect.\n\nFurthermore, fighting to get the government to increase spending and\/or socialize healthcare, education and housing etc. will drastically increase the amount of power the working class by removing massive financial burdens.\n\nThe above, in turn, will weaken the control of capitalism on the working class, especially when we factor in direct attacks against the capitalists.\n\nThis, in turn, will create a more powerful working class, who will have an easier time attacking other forms of governmental control\u00a0*and*\u00a0capitalism.\n\nThis will fuel a continuous cycle that will eventually lead to a more anarchist form, be it communism or market anarchism or whatever.\n\nEssentially, we give the working class some wins and show them that they can operate without need for hierarchies, capitalism or a state, slowly, overtime.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nShould we be cheering these cuts to the government on, if, technically, they are reducing the power of the state?\n\nOr should we be fighting against them, since the working class and fixed income individuals are going to get hurt the hardest by cuts to certain programs?\n\nAnd\/or are we to aim to destroy the most controlling aspects of state first (being the police, prison\/courts and military)?\n\n**Disclaimer 1:**\n\nWhile I would love to reach a purely anarchist form (not sure if I'm anarcho-communist or market anarchist or... I'm still reading), I want to reach this form with the least amount of suffering involved. This is very important to me.\n\nMy biggest reason for not being an ML is related to the fact that many of these ML regimes seemingly lead the working class to their doom in the name of \"the greater good,\" and take an \"any means to the end\" approach. This is not to mention the layers of bureaucracy and power hoarding that occurs within the so-called vanguard party.\n\nI am\u00a0***NOT***\u00a0comfortable with \"sacrificing\" anyone in the name of any ideology.\n\n(Would this be characterized as \"harm reduction?\")\n\n**Disclaimer 2:**\n\nPlease forgive and correct me if I misuse certain words or misrepresent certain concepts. I'm still learning. I promise I am trying my hardest not to be a liberal sellout or reactionary apologist. I want to maximize freedom of everyone and remove the shackles placed on the working class and all of humanity.\n\n**Disclaimer 3:**\n\n***Beararcuy***\u00a0is harder to spell than\u00a0***bourgwazzee***.",

It has fought with SDF against Daesh, Turkish Army, SNA, and HTS, and several people such as [Lorenzo Orsetti](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lorenzo_Orsetti) were martyred. Currently as the biggest pure anarchist militia in Syria, Anarchist Struggle is still fighting for freedom and revolution.\n\n**Conclusion and My Opinion**\n\nThey might not be pure libertarian socialists, but they still carry a new world in their hearts, learning from their mistakes, desiring freedom, and creating humanity's happiness.

        "selftext":"Hello :\\] I've recently joined this sub to learn more about anarchism as a whole and also to engage in more leftist spaces (sorry if people get upset by me using \"left\" since I've seen some people not like the term due to liberals using it and the term being commonly diluted). I self-identify as a socialist\/communist but I've been wanting to learn more of anarchism specifically since learning more and seeing other possibilities\/perspectives is especially important to me.\n\nAnyways, I've always heard people say that \"a leftists biggest enemy is other leftists\" and I wanted to ask how you guys here feel about that. Personally I see it as just another talking point to solidify capitalist-realism and to take credibility away from socialist and anarchist beliefs and movements. Personally despite only scratching the surface of anarchism so far I see the liberals, centre, right, and especially the upper-class as my enemies, not other leftists that don't agree with me on every single thing. I've always thought that if we want change we need each other, and that we can't let capitalist propaganda divide us.\n\n  \nHowever I wanted to hear the thoughts from here. Especially the general anarchist position on socialism, socialist groups, and movements. While there is of course lots of range in socialist beliefs and models of society, it is almost always thought of as a system with government. Obviously this goes against the goals of anarchism, so like I've said too many times already in this post (it's late for me sorry, not great at thinking) is this:\n\nAre the goals of socialist groups\/movements of a society which still contains government a hard-line for you against cooperation or reason for limited cooperation, or is it not an issue for you?\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Y'all cool with socialists and communists or not?\n\n(Sorry if I get\/say somethings wrong, and if I sound to rambly.

        "selftext":"It's probably a common feeling and also a bit strange and unfair, but at various times I feel that my anarchist view of the world comes into direct conflict with important things in my life. I am a public school teacher and an anarchist. I am poor, my students are poor, my students' families are poor, my country is sunk in capitalist chaos and is one of the countries with the greatest social inequality in the world. As a teacher, and as an anarchist, I try to make my students aware of this reality. I use my subject to explain inequality and show them different opportunities they have to break the cycle, to recognize generational trauma, understand themselves more, pay attention to mental health, understand how capitalism works so as not to be sucked in by the system that dehumanizes people. I do all this through demonstrations, activities, showing these opportunities in practice (usually related to undergraduate courses that these students don't have much hope of getting into through the entrance exams), making artistic graffiti projects to demonstrate cooperation and occupation of public space (we painted the school walls), among other things. It's never just a lecture telling them how they should live their lives, it's dynamic, playful, planned and smart. And yet, the amount of influence I have on these teenagers is minimal, obviously. Friends matter and know more, family influences more and even my fellow teachers end up influencing more. I don't want to be the only reference in their lives, but I often feel like I'm running into a wall, that the cruel reality around me and my students is so much more powerful than me. And also, theoretically I work for the state government, I have so much bureaucracy and responsibilities to fulfill that the little energy I have left is to do these things I said I do. And I kinda work for the government, so I feel very hypocritical, even though I know that I'm not, because I'm not a politician, a police officer or anything like that, I'm a teacher inserting myself in the public space, which is where I will have the most influence.\n\nAnd finally, what bothers me most is when I realize that I am being practically forced to replicate professional behaviors in the classroom that, if I don't use, makes it impossible for me to teach a class. For example: in some classes in some schools, if I am not stricter or do not call the school's \"authorities\" such as the principal, I simply cannot teach due to the indisposition and lack of respect I suffer from the students. This lack of interest in education and lack of respect for education professionals in my country is so strong, teachers are devalued and underpaid. and are beaten in the streets by police. It's a culture of teacher hatred in right-wing media that preaches us as indoctrinators, among other crazy things that have created this view among most students' families that school is a place to spend time and have fun with friends, studying doesn't lead to nothing. Students then arrive at school with this mentality and I understand where it all comes from, but I have less than 1 hour with them a week how am I going to explain this to a 16 year old. There's no way, so I end up shouting, taking them out of the classroom, so I can make the most of the little time I have to teach those who aren't like that. And I feel terrible. I studied so many beautiful theories about education at university and I can easily say: most of them are rubbish, all from people who have never set foot in a classroom and taught by university professors who have never even set foot in a public school. Anyway, all of this leaves me confused, angry, feeling guilty and insufficient. And all because I am a public school teacher and also an anarchist. What do you guys think ",

        "selftext":"While researching different fascist movements, both past and present, I have noticed a peculiar set of similarities between them, beyond their defining palingenetic ultranationalism.\n\n1. They gain popularity in the times of economic strife, utilising populist rhetoric to rally the masses around fascists' promises of economic revival and denouncements of ruling moderate politicians - Mussolini exploited the disillusionment and poverty of Italian WWI veterans, Hitler promised to rebuild German economy from the Great Depression and the Treaty of Versailles, Le Pen and Trump both built their support on the popular anger at the effects of neoliberal policies.\n2. They are backed by the economic elite - eg. Hitler's campaign was funded by German industrialists, while Trump's was bankrolled by Elon Musk and shielded from criticism by Jeff Bezos.\n3. They redirect the popular outrage at dire economic conditions away from the capitalist class, towards a scapegoat - for Hitler it was the Jews, the communists, the gays and the trans people, for Le Pen it is immigrants, for Trump it is the immigrants, the \"woke\" and the trans people.\n4. Once in power, they quickly abandon the facade of pro-worker economic populism and readily serve the interests of the owner class - Mussolini banned strikes and non-fascist worker syndicates, Hitler privatised most industry, Trump assembled a cabinet of billionares and multi-millionares, two of which are now in charge of de-regulating their own industries.\n\nThese facts have led me to theorise that a key function of fascism is to act as a lightning rod to capitalism - when the latter creates infuriating poverty and inequality that could result in a mass anti-capitalist revolt, fascists sweep in, backed by the funds and propaganda provided by their elite sponsors, to redirect the popular outrage towards their chosen scapegoat and seize state institutions for themselves.\n\nThis ingenious symbiosis between capitalism and fascism is quadruply dire:\n\n1. It preserves capitalism, with its exploitation and authoritarian working conditions, in spite of the popular rage instilled by its socio-economic consequences.\n2. It bolsters capitalism moreso than typical liberalism does, by placing authoritarians indebted to their corporate sponsors (or said corporate sponsors themselves) in key regulatory positions within state bureaucracy.\n3. It causes severe, often lethal systemic violence towards members of the scapegoat group.\n4. It turns otherwise decent people into bigoted lunatics, through repeated exposure to conspiracy theories propagandised by corporate and, following a fascist takeover, state actors, for the benefit of both actors.\n\na",

Doomscroll? Endure the exploitation as something inevitable and natural? Etch words into your shell casings?\n\nMario's brother is on to something, but the potential power of an act is limited by the collective reaction - if any - to it. All \u201clone wolves\u201d who commit similar acts of violence usually do so in the hope of being the spark to set off some broader movement, and there is never any real social change except through community.\n\nI've been trying to brain-storm some \"collective spells\" we - as unwashed plebs - might try casting in an effort to change our shared material reality for the better. Memes we might conjure to inflict psychic damage on some \u201cthing\u201d that exists physically but without a body - like money.\n\nHow do you guillotine the head off of an idea?\n\nIf one person doing something is an issue, one hundred is a nuisance, ten thousand a concern, one hundred thousand a problem, and by one million+ we\u2019re at a full-blown unrelenting and unstoppable force of nature.\n\nSo - the game?\n\nIt's very simple - we can all interact with it and watch as it changes on a daily basis. The very existence of 'the game' might immediately effect its rankings and narrative, and any person that wants to, can interact with it however they\u2019d like.\n\nA website with two lists on each side of the page - on the left is a list of the wealthiest individuals in Canada - you do not need anything more than a name and a net worth in billions - see [Wikipedia's article on List of Canadians by net worth](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Canadians_by_net_worth).\n\nOn the right hand side of the page, there's a second list of causes of death - any billionaire that died would have an equal number of points assigned for each dollar equivalent to their net worth when they got entropied - so, for example, since [James K. Irving](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_K._Irving) [recently passed at 96, peacefully in his sleep](https:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/business\/billionaire-businessman-james-k-irving-dead-at-96-1.6936770), we'll assign about 5.5 billion \"points\" to \"Natural causes\", which is likely to be our All Time Top Scorer.\n\nIf we wanted to go retroactive and include Barry Sherman, we\u2019d assign about 3 billion points to the ['Murdered - Unsolved'](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barry_Sherman#Death) category - probably not going to find its way to the top 5, an outlier for sure.\n\nNow, anybody can join in when and as they see fit - if they felt a moral obligation or were just looking for something fun to do on a Sunday, for example.\n\nNothing left to live for? \n\nMaybe for the Highest Score of All Time?\n\nEach country could have its own National Leaderboard with a separate list for the International League which is when things would really get interesting - everybody in the world can play together!\n\nSince the \u201cpoints\u201d assigned a category for a wealthy individual\u2019s expiry are completely made up, meaningless, and without any actual value (outside of whatever social value certain groups might apply) it can\u2019t really be argued that the game, website, or list itself is inciting violence or soliciting murder - it\u2019s simply a set of lists - how the greater public decides to react, engage, and participate with the list(s) is what determines how the game ultimately plays out - and how an alternate reality might merge with the one we inhabit now.\n\nActually eating a billionaire will net an additional 10,000,000,000 points - because why not?\n\nThoughts, questions, comments, ideas or concerns?",

        "selftext":"EDIT: just pointing out that this is perhaps a bit US-centric. Sorry for not specifying earlier. I suppose I'm a victim of the same US-centered thinking I loathe :-)\n\n\n\nHi everyone! A confluence of recent events, both at the national level, as well as within my own little city have led me to believe that people are more receptive than at any time in my life to the ideas of the \"left\" (socialism, communism, anarchism, etc.)\n\nI'm 38, so I remember following No WTO protests through punk bands that were vocal about it, the 'war on terror', Occupy, DAPL, BLM, the 2016 race where Bernie seemed credible as a national candidate, Trump, and I'm probably forgetting other formative events).\n\nI grew up working class with parents who voted both Democrat and Republican. They always seemed to have a heavy dose of cynicism and skepticism toward politics and mainly voted exclusively in presidential elections. But I remember saying to my dad once, when I was 8 or 9, something like \"you vote Democrat because Republicans are for rich people and Democrats are for poor people, and we're poor\". I still remember his response: \"No, they are both for rich people\".\n\nOver the years, culture wars and disinformation led my parents to become Trump voters, and here is my main 'thesis': I believe that the *some* of the same energy that exists among Trump voters could be tapped into by those of us with more fair-minded, egalitarian points of view.\n\nFor instance, my city has a problem with our police force being violent and unchecked, with the worst of their crimes being exploitation of sex workers. I had a conversation with my mom about it, mentioning I'd gone to our city council to complain about it, and she told me that back when she was a kid, women knew not to go into certain towns alone, for fear of sexual violence from predatory cops. This really made me feel like there could be some common ground regarding distrust of authority and breaking destructive power structures.\n\nSeeing so many people vote Trump at the same time that Luigi Mangione became a folk hero (I am into anarchy &amp; **peace**, btw) made me realize that there is a massive amount of people that are dissatisfied with the status quo. While I obviously loathe Trump, and believe he has hurt and will hurt many people, perhaps for decades to come, I believe that he reflects a mirror back on the worst parts of American life. He should annex Canada and Greenland, if only to make it clear to the world that yes, the western world is basically ruled by the USA, the nefarious hegemon, due to our excessive military spending as well as our highly consumerist culture that makes us the trough-slurping pigs of the world, while allowing an underclass within our own borders to suffer under the covers.\n\nI believe that if we keep preaching things like distrust of authority, breaking sick power structures, and try to move away from all these tired left-right, Democrat-Republican, false dichotomies, we may be able to reach some allies among Trump voters and people that identify as right-wing or conservative.\n\n**TL;DR: Shared distrust of authority, coupled with a growing awareness of systemic failures, presents an opportunity. By focusing on dismantling oppressive structures and challenging the tired left-right paradigm, we can build bridges with those who, despite their support for Trump, yearn for a more just and equitable society, by engaging in honest, empathetic dialogue that centers on shared values and a collective vision for a better future.**",

        "title":"Critique of Mutual Aid",
        "selftext":"Hi all,\n\nI've been part of a mutual aid group for the past couple years that is explicitly anarchist, abolitionist, and non-hierarchical. Our main project is cooking fresh, nutritious meals for unsheltered folks each week, and we also have a propane program where folks can get free propane to stay warm\/cook. We also distribute harm reduction, clothes, etc. \n\nI've recently been exposed to critiques of the mutual aid project from the socialist\/Marxist point of view. I know one common critique is that much of what is packaged as mutual aid often isn't very mutual, which I think is a valid point-my group is always brainstorming ways to be more truly mutual, such as giving opportunities to the our unsheltered neighbors to come help cook and distribute meals (to the extent that they want to, not as an obligation). That being said, I think even when mutual aid is fairly one-sided, the distinction between how a horizontally-organized, no-strings attached project operates and a neoliberal charity or church is significant enough that I don't have a huge problem with the phrase \"mutual aid.\"\n\nThe critique that has given me more food for thought is over strategy. The arguments I've seen say that mutual aid is essentially just a band-aid that doesn't address root issues, which frankly I think is a pretty uncontroversial thing to say that no one I know in the MA world would disagree with. Where I understand the point is that maintaining a well-functioning mutual aid group is incredibly time intensive, and in theory that time could be spent helping politically organize in a way that would more directly grasp for the levers of power that could ultimately redistribute wealth in a way that would benefit far more people far more greatly than cooking meals every week ever could. \n\nI have access to wealth and have donated a lot of money to more root-cause political projects, but realistically I work full time and contribute what free time I can to MA because I like being involved in my neighbors and because it helps people in the here and now. Part of this is admittedly a bit selfish: I get more satisfaction from MA than I have from helping with political projects, which is important for my mental health as an individual in our capitalist society. I also love being part of a community that takes care of each other, though I've heard socialists critique the focus on community over the focus on a society and the idea that MA groups are little islands of solidarity whereas the Marxist project is to unite the working class across the country and world towards a common cause. One thing I feel is missing from this aspect of the Marxist critique is that in my experience, lots of trans folks are attracted to mutual aid (I'm a cis-male, for what it's worth), and I think part of the reason it speaks more to them is that our \"society\" is largely very hostile to them, and while I'm all about class solidarity, this a reality for a lot of marginalized people that I don't often see addressed from the Marxist lens.\n\nAnyways, this is kind of a jumble of thoughts, but just wanted to see what people who are more anarchist-inclined like myself think about these critiques of MA. Would our time be better spent on political projects that have the possibility of achieving a greater good, and if so, what would that practically even look like?",

Finally in my thirties, I abandoned all I knew in search of different. I had almost nothing except my 3-year-old. I ended up back in school studying sociology, and I fell in love with the reality of a simpler world. I crave the hunter gatherer society. I am the bad apple. I am the off-spring of those in love with money and red hats. And all I want to see is a world with no hierarchy, where everyone owns land or no one does, where no one starves simply for the purpose of providing another with wasted feast. My family always tried to convince me anarchy was chaos and violence. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s peace and simplicity. It\u2019s the freedom to live as one is without social constraints.\n\nI have become such an introvert. I can\u2019t find joy in the superficial. I dedicate most of my life to helping others from a distance avoiding recognition.

We'd been renting and it was a good deal because one side was absolutely unlivable. My in-laws kind of pressured us into the purchase because my FIL has been gutting and fixing houses (and landlording) for decades. We lived in one side while renovating the other.\n\nFast forward to today. We've finally moved in to the new side of the house, and now my in-laws want us to rent out the other side as an income property. I really don't want to do this for a couple of reasons. I hate landlords and the entire concept of doing it. My FIL has had to evict many tenants from his own rental properties throughout the years, and I just don't think I could do that. The entire concept of owning anything to rent it out just fundamentally conflicts with what I think the world should look like (Spoiler alert: I'm an anarchist as well).\n\nWe've discussed doing seasonal AirBnB stuff (which also makes me feel sleezy) so that we'd have it open as an apartment that my mother can stay in if she wants to visit (she lives across the country and is retired).\n\nHas anyone here been a landlord in the past? Any advice on what I can do with the other half of my house without either feeling like a leech or, alternatively, someone who is just letting living space go unused when there are people who legitimately need a roof over their heads?",

Here\u2019s a glimpse of what we\u2019ve accomplished so far :\n- Received the [Jen Angel Grant](https:\/\/anarchistagency.com\/jen-angel-anarchist-media-grant\/).\n- Launched _Mutual Audio_, an anarchist podcast distro (3 episodes and counting).\n- Built a new website to expand our services.\n- One of our member created [zines](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/17OZgbQ3OJjNmROhWv71TxnW8Hv5km7bO\/view?usp=sharing)\n- Began federating communes, like **Well4Ward**, a co-op housing initiative and **Just Wondering**\n- Developed [data vizualisations](https:\/\/af2c.org\/Palestine\/) to help us grapple with the ongoing genocide in Palestine.\nBut we need _your_ help to keep growing !\n### **Current Communes : Join the Action**\nHere are some of our communes and words from them :\n#### Well4Ward\nAre you watching the world go from bad to worse and feeling powerless to do anything?\nWE NEED YOUR HELP TO FIND A WAY FORWARD\nWell4Ward is a housing reform initiative focused on raising funds and providing start up and ongoing support for a new model of co-operative housing. The goal is to get people and communities direct ownership of their homes, and help them set up what they need to maintain it. These distrubuted and interconnected co-operatives form the foundation for community investment and rebuilding a human centered society. But to get this launched, we need some help covering the legal and start up costs. We've set a goal of $3000, this will cover the cost of a lawyer who specializes in the types of bylaws we will need to protect the integrity of our new start up and set us up for successful growth. If we raise more than that, it will go to the costs of developing online infrastructure to support this initiative - a fully featured website and community network. Think of this as an investment in social change, and let yourself dream that it's possible things could get better again if we work together.\nJoin the conversation !\n#### [Just Wondering...](https:\/\/justwondering.io\/)\nIn 2024 we worked on two long-form animated essays which both required quite a bit of research! The first one, \u201cEscape, Resistance and Solidarity - Farmed Animal Sanctuaries as the Heart of the Movement\u201d is an exploration of the solidarity we can extend to (exploited\/farmed) non-human animals through the sanctuary movement and beyond it. The second, \u201cNatural Gas, The Bridge To Climate Disaster\u201d narrates the lies the fossil fuel industry has been telling us for decades to keep us hooked on what they\u2019re selling; it\u2019s also a dedication to climate activists everywhere. Before working on these two, we created three video-poems in solidarity with Palestine which were screened at a few fundraisers. We also held a speculative workshop imagining multispecies education, got the 2024 Jen Angel Anarchist Media Grant, made new stickers and a zine based on one of our animated essays! For 2025 we have another two long-form animated essays already planned - this time, they are both somewhat related to animal politics and animal liberation, from different angles. And we hope we\u2019ll be able to make some more video-poems for Palestine as well and continue working on the drafts we started sometime ago! Every year we have bigger expectations than what we actually manage to do, but this is what keeps us going.\n#### Anarchist Wiki\nAbout half a year ago I started the AnarWiki project ago to preserve a previous attempt at an Anarchist Wiki which was taken off the web (just after being vandalised by Tankies). Subsequently I added some articles from other sources, and made the mistake of trying to import some from Wikipedia (wasted too much time try to fix templates for too little benefit). I\u2019ve been a little sad that there haven\u2019t been other volunteers, but also haven\u2019t made many people aware of it, as I didn\u2019t feel it was quite good enough to launch yet. I\u2019ve also been distracted with pro-Anarchist blog posts and my \u2018Reasons To Hate Capitalism\u2019 series (video version coming soon), which have been more popular than I\u2019ve expected. See this substack In the new year I expect to spend more time on the Wiki, as I believe it could be an important resource, and hope to help get it to a place that others want to be involved, as I feel its also important to be a shared responsibility.\n#### Graphic commune (Samikata)\nI've joined AF2C mid spring and shortly began to collaborate in the propaganda &amp; graphics communes, as well as Well4Ward not too long afterwards. Through the few months here I've created multiple posters including full fledged artworks, which, while outside my comfort zone, definitely helped me to work on my art skills and try different approaches to design. The animation for Well4ward in particular has had a major impact on my capabilities and I feel like it has improved my stroke confidence by a mile. Overall I'm glad I'm here and I hope to be able to contribute more in the coming months. I've met quite a few kind comrades here and hopefully will meet many more in the future.\n### **TL;DR : Let\u2019s Build Together**\nIn one year, we\u2019ve connected initiatives, built tools for change, and started federating communes.\nAre you tired of watching the world crumble?

        "title":"Reasons for lack of libertarian socialism in South Korea ",
        "selftext":"As I explained [before](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/comments\/1hr4vn1\/south_korean_yoon_seokyeol_regime_has_tried_to\/), libertarian socialist movements in South Korea are in terrible status. Let me explain more.\n\n**Mccarthism and fear of North Korean fifth column**\n\nSince 1953, South Korea has been under threat of North Korean attack. And since North Korea is a state capitalist (in other words, state wage slavery) state, Mccarthism is common in South Korea. Korean militarist tyrants, such as [Pak Ch\u014fng-H\u016di](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Park_Chung_Hee), [Ch\u014fn Tu-Hwan](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chun_Doo-hwan) and [No T'ae-U](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roh_Tae-woo), have brainwashed Koreans that **SOCIALISM = COMMUNISM = ML = STALINISM = NORTH KOREA = DICTATORSHIP = TOTALITARIANISM**. Even the concepts of Nordic Model or social democracy are shunned here. (I hate those ideas too. No matter how generous your tyrant is, you are still a slave.)\n\n**Normalization of control**\n\nDue to long-term dictatorship here, control of state and police is normal here. Guns are nearly 100% forbidden, and worker strike or demonstration is often accused of \"NK and Chinese agents that try to spread chaos in society\". If you bring the ideas of squatting or illegalism here, well... good luck.\n\n**Social Darwinism**\n\nOur social studies textbooks teach us that capitalism lets you earn what you deserve, based on your talents and efforts. If you search on slum and the homeless on Internet, they are like, \"Well, you should have studied hard in your youth\" or \"So what? You want to steal our private property for your welfare?\". Such ideas were especially promoted during military dictatorship period, when South Korea had to exploit her people as hard as possible in order to be a developed country. \n\n**Hostility on femenism and idpol**\n\nTo satisfy our complaints on social injustice, [liberals](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Democratic_Party_(South_Korea,_2015)) have made some lipservices - there are [Ministry of Gender Equality and Family](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ministry_of_Gender_Equality_and_Family) and many feminist organizations. However, most of them are TERF and selective feminists. When they illegalized the pornography while advocating male only military conscription, many people started believing that feminism = female supremarcy. Not only feminism but also whole liberal idpol is despised by many young (20-39) men, and [centrist conservatives](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Reform_Party_(South_Korea)) got much popularity via anti-feminism.\n\n**Sabotage of ML**\n\nMany leftist areas, such as parties, NGOs and labor unions are overrun by MLs such as [Progressive Party](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Progressive_Party_(South_Korea,_2017)) so libertarian socialists have little place here.\n\n**Christian fundamentalism**\n\nAlthough I am a born Protestant (Presbyterian) Christian and attend to Church every week, I should admit that Christian fundamentalism is severe here. Due to influence of American evangelicalism, many Christian organizations here - notably Esther Prayer Movement (\uc5d0\uc2a4\ub354\uae30\ub3c4\uc6b4\ub3d9\ubcf8\ubd80) and InterCP(\uc778\ud130\ucf65) - are based on fundamental ideas. You can see Korean flag, American flag, Israeli flag and cross together in many South Korean far-right marches and demonstration. While Christian rate is roughly 25% in South Korea, fundamentalist ideas such as Homophobia, Islamophobia and patriarchy are widely spread. Can you believe that there is only one church (\uc12c\ub3cc\ud5a5\ub9b0\uad50\ud68c, Sumdol Presbyterian Church) that openly welcomes LGBTs, and it is designated as a heretic church by roughly half of South Korean Protestant churches?\n\nDespite these adversities and hardships, I am convinced that we - not only South Koreans but also our compatriots in North Korea - will, with the help from companions in Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mongolia, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines, etc., create humanity's happiness for ourselves and all. In 1198, [Man J\u014fk](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Manjeok) fought right in this land against class system, and in 1812, [Hong Ky\u014fng-Rae](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hong_Gyeong-rae) rose up here against feudalist exploitation. We are descendants of Man J\u014fk, Hong Ky\u014fng-Rae, [Kim Chwa-Chin](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kim_Chwa-chin), and [Yi Hoe-Y\u014fng](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lee_Hoe-yeong), and **we will let the people command and the government obey!**",

        "selftext":"THE CITY OF ELGIN HAS \nDECLARED WAR \nAGAINST ALL UNHOUSED PEOPLE\nIT\u2019S TIME TO FIGHT BACK!.\n\nOn the night of December 19th, 2024, in a city hall courtroom of only a handful of people, Elgin city council members approved and celebrated a plan to eliminate \u201cTent City\u201d, along with all other tents and self-made structures that act as shelter made by those living on the streets. This plan was discussed and decided on without the knowledge or presence of the hundreds of houseless people living in Elgin.\n\n\u201cTent City\u201d, located on roughly 8 acres between the Fox River and Route 31 in Elgin, has been a site used for encampments by people experiencing houselessness ever since the demolition of a metal fabrication factory there back in 1990. For many of these residents, this is the only space in the city that offers safety and accommodations that allow them autonomy over their lives. With this autonomy, the residents of Tent City have spent time and energy over the years building and sustaining this community. \n\nThe City of Elgin plans to evict all residents of Tent City, along with the hundreds of other houseless individuals residing in tents and self-made structures around the city of Elgin, moving only 50 of them to the Lexington Inn &amp; Suites for a duration of four months. This hotel is widely known for bed bug and cockroach infestations, along with sanitary conditions that only barely meet city code.\n\nThere is currently no plan for housing after the four months has ended. \n\u201cWe know this is a temporary solution,\u201d Assistant City Manager Karina Nava said. \n\nALL houseless individuals, including those selected for the four-month stay at the hotel, are ordered to immediately vacate the premises of their encampment or face trespassing charges. After every resident is evicted from \u201cTent City\u201d in particular, the \u201csite will be secured\u201d and \u201ccleared and remediated\u201d. Furthermore, the city promises to instate a \u2018zero tolerance policy\u2019 for any future tents and self-made shelters, leaving those who are unable to access options provided by the city at extreme risk to the impending winter temperatures presently and long-term.\n\nRather than meeting houseless people where they are, where they feel safe, and investing in resources that could help them re-build after two recent fires, the City of Elgin would rather spend more money and resources by evicting them all, subjecting them to the trauma of forced displacement. Parks Superintendent Greg Hulke estimated the cost of the eviction and clearing to be between $2 million and $2.5 million, with the process taking two to four months, not including the cost of the relocation of the selected 50 residents.\n\nWhile \u201csafety\u201d has been said to be the reason for all of this, it is abundantly clear that the real motive is the same beautification process seen happening in many other gentrified cities. What this eviction plan fails to reveal is an anti-homelessness motive integrated into the city\u2019s vision of boosting property value. \n.\nElgin Police Chief Ana Lalley said the department will begin the process on or about Jan. 20.  \nThe unhoused people of Elgin deserve the autonomy to determine their own living situations.\nThis plan is not a rescue \u2013 it is an eviction, and for many people, it may be a death sentence. \n\nDEFEND THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN SOCIETY \nFROM LOSING WHAT LITTLE THEY HAVE LEFT\n\nJOIN US FOR A RALLY SATURDAY JANUARY 4TH \n@ 1PM @ THE CORNER OF E.

        "title":"South Korean Yoon Seok-Yeol regime has tried to remove the legacy of the anarchist anti-colonial movement",
        "selftext":"sources and related articles: [Korean anarchist movement](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_People%27s_Association_in_Manchuria), [South Korean New Right](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Right_(South_Korea)), and [Hong Beom-Do](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hong_Beom-do)\n\nI'm a teenage student in South Korea. (And that's why my English is awkward) Though I am not an anarchist, but a libertarian socialist like Bookchin and Ocalan, [recent events](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2024_South_Korean_martial_law_crisis) brought me here to write a really, really long article about how our government has tried to erase anarchist anti-Japanese resistances from 1910 to 1945.\n\nAs you know, Korean anarchists fought bravely when Japanese imperialists occupied Korea. [Kim Chwa-Chin](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kim_Chwa-chin) and his crews made an autonomous zone in Korean diaspora in Manchuria, and there was even a small [secret guerilla army](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heroic_Corps).\n\nAfter the independence, all the South Korean politicians - [left-wing nationalists](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Progressive_Party_(South_Korea,_2017)), [centrist](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Democratic_Party_(South_Korea,_2015)) [liberals](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rebuilding_Korea_Party), [centrist conservatives](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Reform_Party_(South_Korea)) and [hard-line conservatives](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/People_Power_Party_(South_Korea)) have acknowledged anarchist roles in Korean independence. Just... just recall how Ukrainian far-rights try to downplay Makhnovshchina as if it was just a Ukrainian anti-Russian nationalist organization. The same thing has happened in South Korea for 70 years, especially because South Korea had to \"prove\" to Korean Diasporas ( [Chaoxianzu](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_Chinese), [Zainichi](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Koreans_in_Japan), etc ) that South Korea is legitimate Korea, and North Korea has to do nothing with Korean independence activities.\n\nHowever, things have changed when Yoon Seok-Yeol, a supporter of [New-Right](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Right_(South_Korea)), came to power. As you see in the article, [New-Rights ](https:\/\/namu.wiki\/w\/%EB%89%B4%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8(%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD))believe that [Korea before the occupation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korean_Empire) was a feudal state that deserved to collapse, and that Japanese Empire came to Korea to \"modernize\" and \"industrialize\" Korea. (Just like how Chinese propaganda says about Tibet) They believe that Korean independence activists were \"terrorists\", and that their modern counterpart is North Korea. They say that they are \"anti-nationalists that fight against chauvinists\", but they uphold Japanese nationalism.\n\nSo, with fascists like this, Yoon Seok-Yeol tried to denounce Korean anarchism and its legacy. [They tried to remove the busts of various independence activists, including Kim Chwa-Chin, from Korea Military Academy](https:\/\/english.hani.co.kr\/arti\/english_edition\/english_editorials\/1106781.html). They said that they were alleged of collaborating with \"commies\", despite **Kim Chwa-Chin having been assassinated by an ML!** Even[ Lee Hoe-Yeong](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lee_Hoe-yeong), another anarchist, was considered a \"commie\".\n\nOther three  independence activists - who were not anarchists - were accused of \"being communists\" as well. However, [Chi Chongchon](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chi_Ch%27%C5%8Fngch%27%C5%8Fn) and[ Lee Beom-Seok](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lee_Beom-seok_(prime_minister)) were right-wing nationalists, and [Hong Beom-D](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hong_Beom-do)o, while participating in USSR communist party, never upholded ML for a single time. Also, Hong Beom-Do died before North Korea was established, so he has nothing with North Korea. **But all of five were accused of \"reds\".**\n\nIn contrast, South Korean dictator [Park Chung-Hee](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Park_Chung_Hee), the greatest idol of South Korean conservatives and New-rights, participated in [Worker's Party of South Korea](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Workers%27_Party_of_South_Korea) in late 1940s. This shows how contradictory they are.\n\nNot only that, but also look at [this](https:\/\/imnews.imbc.com\/news\/2024\/politics\/article\/6627667_36431.html).

( And also, when it comes to general Kim Chwa-Chin, he was active in Northern[ Jiandao](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jiandao) \\- since near Northern Jiandao were socialist, communist countries, Kim Chaw-Chin must have been related to such forces too. )\n\nIn this routine, New-rights are continuously trying to remove anarchist struggles in Korean independence movement.\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. Our government has caught schizophrenia: it believes in some brainwashing **like SOCIALISM = COMMUNISM = ML(M) = NORTH KOREA = DICTATORSHIP = TOTALITARIANISM and MILITARISM = ANTI-COMMUNISM = LIBERAL DEMOCRACY.**\n2. Therefore, our government is a strong supporter of Mccarthysm.\n3. And that's why our government has tried to remove anarchist legacies of Korean independence activism, and made a self-coup last month.\n\nedit: Yoon Hui-seok, not Hui-sook",

        "selftext":"When people ask what they can do to contribute practically as anarchists, the usual answers seem to be, join or start a local mutual aid network, or look for your local Food Not Bombs group. \n\nHistorically (here I'm thinking 1860s to the late 1930s), anarchist practice had two main strands:\n\n- building support networks that could replace existing hierarchies \n- education, agitation and propaganda \n\nBoth libertarian and state socialists were using education, agitation and propaganda in the decades leading up to and after WWI. In practice, this involved organising talks and debates at social clubs, village halls or union meetings, talking at public speaking pitches, putting up posters and distributing socialist newspapers and socialist literature. \n\nThe environment these activists were working in was completely different to the modern world. With no TV or internet, people voluntarily went out to hear activists speak, just because it was something interesting to do. In some places, public speaking pitches were almost competitive arenas, with speakers vying for the largest crowd. Everything was new and people were often fighting for basic rights. People weren't yet jaded by the failure of unions or socialist parties to deliver on their promises.\n\nNowadays, we have an almost unlimited worldwide audience for propaganda and education, but it is easily eclipsed by all the other noise. Films, TV, internet, and the ever present advertising of consumer goods. In most developed countries, people aren't fighting for basic working rights or a basic standard of living. The nuclear family and home entertainment have drastically reduced the amount of time people socialise in public or communal spaces.\n\nModern anarchist propaganda often seems to take the form of \"subvertising\" or similar stunts that subvert the language and tools of consumerism. To me, this seems to be preaching to the converted, and not effective at conveying a message to ordinary working people. \n\nAre the approaches to education, agitation and propaganda that were effective 100 years ago relevant today? If not, what is?",

Because power is like cancer, it can corrupt a society coming from anywhere. It can be through charisma, brute force, personal connections. It can be trying to maintain an organization or position long after it's socially useful. The corruption of institutions. It's always there, there's no point where it's permanently defeated. \n\nBut we evolved psychological immune responses to it, so we root for the underdog, distrust the powerful, ... and I believe being an anarchist is being very deliberate about it, strategizing, and collaborating to fight power without the aim of taking it for yourself. But it also needs creative aims, positive goals, so it's worth fight for and doesn't devolve into pure reactionary violence.\n\nAnd it's important to have a sense of priority. Different groups are always vying for power, and a risk for the anarchist is going against the already weaker group, helping the stronger one just take over. When the spanish come to your land, it's probably not the best time to riot against tribal leaders or stop making weapons.\n\nRight now, we have the richest men in the world, the president of the most powerful country, most big names in \"decentralized finance\" in a small connected clique. \n\n\"*The ability to move money fluidly* and the erosion of the nation-state are closely related\", Peter Thiel said, as he joined with Elon Musk to try and allow everyone to move money fluidly.   \n\"We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it.\" - Elon Musk, in a discussion about lithium mining in Bolivia\n\nIn Europe, one of, maybe the most bureaucratic organization ever conceived is leading the fight against big tech, investing billions to provide free, open alternatives in hardware and software that can help guarantee our freedoms. These are strange times. It may well be that the end of the state, at this moment, would be the worst thing to ever happen to anarchism.\n\nWith enough technological superiority, the rules of the WTO on IP, we may end up in a stable de facto world government, and because the violence is outsourced to the state\/local elites\/PMCs and the information is filtered by big tech, we don't even see how it went wrong or who to fight. If we even have the means to do so. Other than MAYBE China or the EU, I think no one can pose challenges without a coup, corruption charges, a forex crisis, the opposition suddenly swimming in money, ... . But the natural resources are de jure under democratic control in most of the world and preserving it has a decent support. People can control data, information flow, ecosystems, communities. So in a way the path to being an anarchist was never more clear.\n\n\n\n",

And if any did figure it out, they probably figured it out too late, or were silenced by those with power or those too blind to see the truth.\n\nNow history is repeating itself. This so called USA is failing. And the common people, LGBT, ethnic or religious minorities, the mentally ill, poor and homeless... their all being played against each other. Fortunately, this time there are those among these groups who see the truth. But currently they lack the will to act on it. Or at least they have not found a ripe opening to make a good move.\n\nSo what would a good opening be? ",

That's why I've thought of a story set in a post revolutionary world, seen from a POV of someone who has travelled there from the past, which should highlight the differences between our present world and our target world. So....\n\n  \nThe premise: Anarchists have successfully won the world through a long term revolution. God intervened in the world and gave many anarchists powers, which enabled them to win the world. But now they\u2019re facing a problem. The earth\u2019s core is set to explode in 300 years, and none of the scientists from the present world have a solution. Which is why one anarchist with powers over time summons a queer scientist from the past who has the intelligence and capability of solving this problem. THEY are an incredibly brilliant polymath who were taken too soon from this world by crime. Now normally fixing the world would be no problem, but unfortunately, the fascists have also acquired powers of their own, and want to remake the world in their image. So now, the real challenge begins. How will the anarchists prevail?\n\n\n\nMy name is Siddharth, and I'm an anarchist from India. I want to create a story that inspires more people to become anarchists, and hopefully this should help. I want y'alls feedback on this.

This section also goes over using bashing as a means of furthering the cause over random acts of senseless bashing.\n\n\\- The Revolution and Its People: A section going over unity amongst revolutionaries. Encourages looking past the small disagreements in prospect of us all having the same goal. This section also goes over how to break people out of the web of lies our modern politicians and corporations have stuck us all in.\n\n\\- The Revolution and Education: A section that talks about education and college. Encourages others to post any and all information online, in order to begin the long path destroying the concept of colleges by putting the knowledge in the hands of the people, free of charge.\n\n\\- Revolutionary Politics: A section that covers the meaninglessness of parties and how taking sides in the modern political sphere is working with the oppressor. Encourages breaking from \"the two big parties\" and abandoning the political compass, as they're both tools used to divide us.\n\nI will have another work in the future that expands upon this should it get enough attention called A Modern Revolution in Action.\n\nWhat is the general consensus here?

        "title":"Some tips for writing for prisoners",
        "selftext":"# Some basics \n\nFirst thing, look up the rules for the prison itself. Every prison is a little different and so each person will have their own rules about sending things like letters and packages so make sure you do your research before sending anything. This is important because anytime you mess up at best it means that the package or delivery will just be sent back and at worst it could mean that the prisoner themselves could be punished. At worst worst you could be punished but very unlikely unless of course you send something illegal. So do some research into the prison and their rules, they have rules so look them up.\n\n# Letters \n\nLetters are the most basic thing you can send and letters are fun to get. You should know that prisoners often when they send letters back they have to send it with their own post stamps and those cost money inside the prison so if you don't get a message back it's nothing personal it's probably just because they can't afford it, they're too busy, or they have too many letters to respond to. But that is okay. You should also know that prison guards typically remove the envelope and the letter from each other because they have to open the letter and read it themselves first. This causes some problems such as the fact that the envelope gets separated meaning that anything you write on the envelope will not be necessarily given to the prisoner. If you want to return address put it in the letter itself. If you send anything like photographs, make sure to number all of the photographs and then in the letter itself inventory all of the photographs. When it comes to the letters number the letters like this \"\\#\\# out of [total]\" this is so they know how many letters there were total and what number the letter currently is. This is so if the letters ever get lost which if they're read by the guards they might the prisoner will know which letters are missing. It's helpful because they could try to petition to have them. Check the rules of the prison as I already said because sometimes there are different rules about the restrictions on letters. Sometimes these restrictions make no sense but they have to be followed anyway. Restrictions on color, restrictions on whether or not you can print on both sides of a page, the number of pages you can send total, all of these things could be restrictions depending on the prison. Check the rules first.\n\n# Etiquette \n\nWhen it comes to letter etiquette there are also different rules to follow. The first thing is do not talk about the crime that they had committed. Don't do that. First off if they have not been sentenced yet and are still awaiting trial then it could be a problem for them. Don't do it it puts them in a weird position. Second even if they do get charged it's still a really weird position to put them in because it's very personal as well as the fact that they may not want to talk about it. If they want to talk about it then that's different but don't ask them about it. Instead talk about other things. It's okay to talk about other stuff about the prison, you don't need to pretend that they're not prisoners but don't talk about their crime, and don't talk about any other illegal activity either. Remember, anything you say will be read by the guards. This is also one of the reasons why when you send letters it will take a while for them be able to be read by the prisoner because they have to be read by the guards and if your letter is 1 in 1000 letters, it's going to take a while. \n\n# Packages \n\nWho doesn't love a surprise package? Prisoners. The thing is is that surprises are not really the best thing for prisoners. You because when you surprise a prisoner you end up typically actually surprising the guards. Prisoners can be punished for things like the books that you send or the the gifts that you give. If you want to give a gift sometimes there are organizations out there that are things like books behind bars or some kind of organization like that and they are dedicated to providing approved books to prisoners. There are probably organizations out there to help give approved to gifts for prisoners.\n\n# Phone calls\n\nWhen it comes to LM it's very unlikely that you'll be able to call him however when it comes to other prisoners you may be interested in corresponding with, prisoners typically have a call list and they will put people on that call list. The prisoner can put people on that call list such as family and friends. If you're not on the list you will not be approved when you call the prison. If you are not on the call list or they don't put you on the call list don't take it personally, it's because they don't have space or they're trying to save that space for someone else. Also they have to pay for their own minutes. \n\n# Money \n\nOkay maybe you want to give money to LM instead. Maybe he could use it to buy things. That's a nice thing to do but the problem is is that one there is a cap on the amount of money that you can put on someone's books which means account but also don't give them too much money because if a prisoner has too much money they can end up being a Target in prison because once it starts getting around that person has a lot of money they could be targeted by other prisoners to essentially try to give them things. And the thing is that at least in the US male prisons are especially violent. A lot more than female prisons apparently. So yeah probably don't put money on people's accounts without asking.\n\n# Other \n\nI don't really know where to put this information but I also just want to share some personal experience that I have when it comes to how restrictive the rules for sending letters can be sometimes. When I was involved in a different political movement and there were people who were arrested on bogus charges relating to the violation of their civil rights, and this was happening in Atlanta Georgia, restrictions involved requiring special USPS postal paper. So it had to be pre-stamped postal paper from USPS and it couldn't be anything else. It was really that restrictive. This meant that if you didn't send a letter on that little piece of paper that was no bigger than a napkin folded mind you, and it had a pre-printed stamp on so they were prepaid, then the prison would not accept it. Do I think that they made this rule specifically to make it harder to send to those prisoners? Absolutely, I absolutely think so. That was not a normal rule and I know that for the most part when it comes to sending letters to prisoners that rule is not in place. If you go on to websites to write to prisoners you will not find that rule. That was a rule that I believe they implemented because of the nature of those people. So watch out.",

Basically, right now he's worried about the ease of it and to the lesser extent, the social stigma.\n\nI know this is a weird question to ask on an anarchist sub but I avoided the Greek sub because I don't speak Greek, obviously, and have to type through a translator, which I'm sure is frustrating for people reading it.",

From ~1895 to ~1908 a weekly paper was published in Italian called La Questione Sociale with the subtitle \"Periodico Socialista-Anarchico\". I read somewhere online that approximately 2000 copies were printed weekly, I'm not sure of the truth to this claim but considering there were at least hundreds of anarchists in Paterson during this time period it sounds reasonable.\n\nIn 1908 this publication was banned from circulation, and renamed until an FBI raid in 1920 completely seems to have seized the operation. \n\nI would like to see if there is any way to find\/retrieve any copies of this publication. I can't seem to find a single issue. Given how far back in time this is, and the FBI likely destroying anything they found during their raid of the bookstore\/printing location, I'm not too optimistic. If I can't find anything after a decently exhaustive search I would at least like to describe the steps I took and where I searched so maybe someone in the future could build off of this. \n\nIf I do find anything my goal is to summarize some of the issues discussed and also translate into English. \n\nIf you know of any other non-anarchist communities that have knowledge in finding old documents I would love to hear about these too. Thank you in advance for any advice on how to even start seeing what can be recovered :) \n\nAlso, I am aware there are several publications called La Questione Sociale around the world, I am currently only interested in finding the Paterson publication.

        "selftext":"A full revolution against capitalism in America is a risky move. Considering that revolutions are bigger and more complicated then pop culture portrays them as. And France and Russia learned that the hard way when they just replaced one tyranny with another. So, if a full revolution becomes necessary, what do you think are the big mistakes France and Russia made in their revolutions that America should avoid? Here are three I have right now.\n\n1. Reliance on strongmen. People like Robespierre, Stalin, all initiallt presented themselves as ideal for the revolution. But either revealed their true nature over time, or got greedy. We in America MUST watch out for potential strongmen within our own ranks. If any are found, they should either be removed, or monitored VERY closely.\n2. Scapegoating. One of the saddest characters in the French Revolution, was Marie Antoinette. She was a favorite scapegoat in the French Revolution with propaganda portraying her as a thrifty spender and the infamous \"Let them eat cake.\" fiasco. In truth, she had VERY little power within her own social group, her husband made most of the poor decisions, and she NEVER said \"Let them eat cake.\" This is a reminder that even the rich have their hierarchies and those with little power among them. Plus, the French Revolution was rather infamous for misogyny. So we MUST NOT allow rich women to create misogyny. Perhaps some rehabilitation sessions could help?\n3. Killing children. Everyone knows of the tragic deaths of the Romanov children. And rich children were also slaughtered without mercy in the French Revolution as well. Spoiled brats or not, children don't deserve death. Perhaps some special schools or education sessions to integrate them into a more egalitarian society could be of use? Adoption should also be on the shelf but only for very specific circumstances. Additionally, we should also note if any rich children are the victims of parental abuse.\n\nDoes anyone else know of any notable mistakes made all those centuries ago and ways to avoid them?",

        "title":"Seeking ideas for a thought experiment about nonviolence",
        "selftext":"Hello,\n\nApologies if I have misread the rules and this post is inappropriate here (I couldn't find anything specifically against it).\n\nThe thought experiment is this: suspend all disbelief and imagine getting entirely rid of humans' capacity for physical violence. In an instant, every person becomes incapable of hitting, stabbing, shooting, forcefully grabbing, etc. Violence just becomes impossible for us, no loopholes. Can't harm people, can't harm other animals either (though they can still hurt us).\n\nIn such an improbable scenario, I believe humanity would \"naturally\" end up organising itself along anarchist principles. If no one can be forced, then how could it be otherwise? I'm extremely pessimistic about our species in the real world, but in this fictional one I can't see how authoritarians could possibly keep ruling the world. We'd have to peacefully cooperate and share resources equitably and all contribute as best we can. Is this naive or short-sighted? \n\nSure, at first the rich and most middle class would freak out about their stuff getting redistributed (I think the term they would use is \"egregiously stolen by terrorists\" or something like that), and could try to go on punitive expeditions, destroying houses and things, but that could only go on for so long, and they are so vastly outnumbered there could be effective community organising to peacefully prevent most mass destruction. \n\nIn such a world, stores get emptied out quickly... but unless you hide the stuff super well, anybody can take it, even if you try to hoard. Which eventually leads to people avoiding pointless effort and instead agreeing collectively to share what there is, and share in the burden of producing what is needed.  \n\nThe current economic system should collapse quickly, because the 5% of the population already actively trying to disrupt capitalism despite the risk to their safety and freedom would become unstoppable. And they'd be joined by tons of cowards like me who are not doing anything now but would jump at the chance if it was consequence-free (no getting killed or maimed, no jail). You could sabotage every polluting company, block major roads, ports, airports, etc. nobody could stop you. So the demands of workers and ecologists would have to be met, one way or another. \n\nOn the other hand, what are fascists going to do? Try to steal my kids' favourite plush toy to hurt their feelings? I'll follow them home and do the same to their stuff haha. Am I lacking imagination here? What would the far right do in this event? What could do they do against us that wouldn't automatically be turned against them? I know they're nihilistic, but how long would they keep trying to burn the world down if their efforts were always crushed by a handful of dedicated activists? If all pipelines and oil rigs are destroyed (and I firmly believe they quickly would be), how can an oil company survive? Same for all other mass polluters and exploiters.\n\nI've long been attempting to finish my novel that tells the story of the days, weeks, months after this event. I've got many drafts but I struggle to complete them, and it might be that I need a reality check on my basic assumptions. Or rather, simply new perspectives on how things might evolve in such a scenario. To be clear I'm not even really aiming for realism (I'm not smart\/dedicated enough for that), it's more of a fun comedy with hopefully strong anarchist vibes, but still, the societal angle feels crucial to me. I just wish that part of my story was better, fuller.\n\nAny thought you can spare would help, thanks!",

Anarchists were huge during the Russian civil war, and the Mexican revolution. The USSR backed leftist factions during the Spanish civil war, possibly including anarchist militias. What seems odd is that none of these militias ever produced, or where awarded, a single pin, let alone a medal. Supposedly Hungarian anarchists might have had a pin of two at some point, but I can find no evidence of this.\n\nAccording to the Chronicling America project, the sole physical object representing American anarchists in the 1800s was the red flag. Spain's anarchist uniform seems to consist of just the red\/black garrison cap, with variations in form and wear, and civilian clothing. I'm guessing the caps the flags were homemade?\n\nOutside of printed materials (books, posters, pamphlets), that seems to be about it for all anarchist memorabilia until the 1970s with the punk rock movement, and even that stuff looks to be very DIY oriented as a rule.\n\nIs anarchist merch really such a new phenomenon?",

I dont have access to really digitize anything. Nor do i have much money. \n\nIm trying to organize a type of peaceful resistance within my area. Well country. Against Pierre Polliviere. I know many here are total abstentionists. Under most circumstances i am an abstentionist. However, this is the rare time i am no longer an abstentionist and i recognize the MAJOR threat conservative politicians have. Therefore i need to take direct action and help steer the ship another direction.\n\nIts a long bit of explanation, i explained it in some comments and so i can copy and paste what i have left somewhere else. \n\nBut essentially our resistance needs propagandists. For digital posters. Thats way its easier to spread the word and can accumulate a mass of followers much faster into the resistance. \n\nI personally came to call the resistance \"crush Pierre\". It is to wage counter propaganda campaign against them with intellectualism style propaganda that is to rhe betterment of the individuals well being and not an unjust authority figure. That is the intention. I firmly belive intellectualism is one of the biggest threats to fascists. They have tried to hard to protect their safe echochambers where moderates have remained brainwashed. No one is breaking the pattern.\n\nOne commenter going against them is like removing a single brick from their skyscraper (pierres x for example). They just come back and replace that brick right after. But if we get a bunch of concentrated counter propaganda on particular targets, its like us constantly removing bricks. Eventually that skyscraper is going to come collapsing down. And we can help shift the current global trend of democratic backslide.\n\nThey want us to think its futile i promise! But i personally believe this is one of their greatest weaknesses. Why else did Hitler destroy intellectualism? It was a threat to his power.\n\nBrothers and sister its important. I want this movment to spread to different countries operating in cells against different particular politicians. Waging information war. It is peaceful, and contributes well to the cause of achieving equality. \n\nSo if anyone would like to help let me know. The posters dont have to be complicated. And we can get this ship moving in the right direction. If you want a link to the subreddit i made i can leave it in the comments. I might need mods if or when it reaches a bigger amount of people.\n\n",

Nonetheless I wanted to know your opinion and\/or broader Anarchist theory on local electoralism more specifically. To clarify by local electoralism I mean either:\n\na. Local or regional direct initiatives such as ballot initiatives, town halls, etc\n\nb. Local level elections for positions such as Town Council, School Board, etc\n\nIn general I tend to favor participation in these measures for the following reasons:\n\n1. These measures tend to be more accountable to the general public and the popular will is more likely to be reflected in these elections and initiatives. In general local level elections tend to be far more accountable to democratic will than national ones.\n\n2. Individual participation has a greater impact as these races may be decided by dozens or handfuls of votes.\n\n3. These measures and elections tend to have more immediate impacts on communities and individuals especially pertaining to hot-button issues such as wages, abortion, or LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nObviously, however, I am not well acquainted with Anarchist theory and there may be certain arguments for or against that I am unaware of. Also as a disclaimer this is not an endorsement of any specific state office or political candidate just a broader theoretical question.

Born in 1853 in Italy, Malatesta dedicated his life to challenging oppressive systems and fighting for a society built on freedom, solidarity, and mutual aid.\n\nMalatesta\u2019s vision of anarchism went beyond mere philosophy\u2014he believed it was a practical and achievable way of life. In this episode, we explore:\n\n* His critiques of government as inherently oppressive and exploitative.\n* His rejection of reformism and calls for grassroots, bottom-up revolution.\n* His innovative ideas on **anarchist communism**, where cooperation replaces competition and decentralized, voluntary organization takes the place of hierarchical rule.\n* His emphasis on non-violence and education, advocating for revolutionary consciousness as the foundation for change.\n\nWe also dive into Malatesta\u2019s personal story:\n\n* His work as a laborer, which grounded him in the struggles of the working class.\n* His participation in uprisings, exile, and imprisonment as a revolutionary nomad.\n* His unwavering belief in a world without borders, driven by international solidarity.\n\nThis episode is perfect for anyone interested in the intersection of history, philosophy, and social justice. Whether you\u2019re new to anarchism or a seasoned activist, Malatesta\u2019s ideas offer fresh insights into building a better world.\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 **Watch or listen now on YouTube:**  [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r1paPach\\_MU](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r1paPach_MU)",

        "selftext":"As someone with a CID number &amp; months of my life lost to county jail, I recently surprised myself during a debate with a leftist where I found myself defending police sweeps in major cities.  I've been homeless before.  I've been in sweeps before.  I've had friends lose everything again &amp; again when they've been shuffled between parts of the same shit-stained dystopia by the pigs. I've been a traveler &amp; a homebum.\n\nYa'know, I'm in recovery now.  I got clean years ago, and I meet a lot of other dirty kids who got it together.  I hate to say it, but it's almost always the desperation of imprisonment that led my friends to sobriety.  Abstinence from mind-altering substances is radical &amp; essential praxis, but I won't work to outline these merits in this post.\n\nAlthough I don't want to admit it, the state's monopoly of violence, and their capacity to forcefully remove addicts from their circumstances is often essential to their recovery.  I've seen some hippies do it before - bring a kid too strung out to the woods, feed them &amp; do a sit with 'em, but that's not an option for the majority of addicts today.\n\nIn absence of a community-oriented intervention, how do we save lives?  Somehow, the clearest choice seems to intentionally suspend their substance use, and provide access to alternative methods of finding meaning in life.  Prisons really fucking suck at this, and I don't want to sounds like I'm suggesting that we give more power to state agencies, but as they have so successfully commodified &amp; institutionalized this healing, there seems to be no other alternative.\n\nWhere does that bring us?  Do we stop the sweeps, or do we let more die in the streets?  I don't believe in the NA adage that one must find their lowest point to recover, but holding anyone in a misery they want so badly to be liberated from seems a disservice to them and a downward pretentiousness we must disabuse ourselves of.\n\nThese prison walls are used to contain radicals, minorities, the poor &amp; house the mentally ill in horrifying conditions.  After a spending a month in the SHU, I know the true meaning of this horror, and I wish it on no creature.  I've spent months running recovery meetings in my quad, and counseling other women.  I've seen the power of their transformations, and have faith in the seeds of hope I've planted.  In no other place would they have found this while so deep in their addiction.\n\nThe duality of their loss of freedom must be recognized.  Until all are free no one is free. - XVX\n\ntldr:  We must recognize prison abolition as an essential merit of anarchist practice, but in highly industrialized cities, allowing addicts to continue to wallow in their misery is a crime of spirit to them.  This post explores my thoughts on the subject as a former prisoner.",

One of the phones they charged and had on, but they didn't get it a sim card, and the other they had off but with a sim card in it. The one without a sim card sent the entire day's worth of data (sounds, location, etc.) all at once when they put the sim card in. If anybody knows this video that'd be great to share.\n\nI could imagine such an agency could isolate devices which pop in and out of their data harvesting network. Seems he was using his laptop at the mcdonalds with their wifi when he was confronted by police in the Mcd's.\n\nMaybe it's just a simple employee calling authorities in hopes of getting cash, idk, I just thought I'd share my idea and see what others have to say.",

        "title":"Escape of the UHC defender (a short story) ",
        "selftext":"\nThe night was thick with fog as the UHC defender sped through the streets of New York City on a stolen e-bike, its electric hum muffling the pounding of his heart. He\u2019d just taken down Brian Thompson, the evil CEO who had turned the city's healthcare system into a nightmare, but escaping the aftermath was proving far more difficult than he anticipated.\n\nAs he weaved through the narrow alleys and dodged the relentless lights of police cars, a familiar, overwhelming wave of adrenaline flooded his senses. His eyes flicked nervously to the rearview, catching glimpses of flashing red and blue lights behind him. The NYPD was closing in, the evil CEO's death having set the city's most powerful force on his trail. \n\nBy the time he reached Central Park, his legs ached, and his breath was shallow. But there, amidst the towering trees and quiet paths, the hero believed he might find a moment of respite. Ditching the e-bike in a shadowed corner, he adjusted his mask, a symbol of his unwavering identity, the defender of healthcare for all. \n\nAs he caught his breath, a soft voice interrupted the stillness. \n\n\"You're not like the others, are you?\" \n\nTurning, the UHC defender found himself face-to-face with a woman, her beauty striking enough to make even the cold-hearted hero falter. Her eyes, wide and full of mystery, seemed to search deep into his soul, and before he could respond, she stepped closer, her voice a tempting whisper.\n\n\u201cWhy hide behind that mask? You\u2019ve already done so much for the world. Don\u2019t you want to feel... human again?\u201d \n\nThe question hung in the air, and for a moment, the weight of his responsibilities, the years of fighting, seemed to push down on him. His fingers brushed the edge of the mask, and his mind was clouded with doubt. He hesitated. \n\n\"Just for a moment,\" he thought. But then the sound of a camera click pierced the night. His heart sank. He looked around, and there it was\u2014an ominous red light flickering from a streetlight across the park. A hidden camera had captured him.\n\nThe hero\u2019s heart sank. It was the NYPD, the bodyguards of wealth and greed, known for their tireless pursuit of anyone who threatened the established order. They would stop at nothing to find him now.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t risk being caught. He had to be smarter, faster. \n\nWith a swift motion, he pushed the woman away, his eyes locking onto hers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t risk it.\u201d Without waiting for a reply, he vanished into the shadows, leaving the temptation of human connection behind. \n\nAs the camera footage was transmitted to the police, the hero\u2019s mind worked quickly. He ducked into an alley and pulled out his phone, accessing an encrypted underground network known only to the city\u2019s most resourceful. He quickly tapped into the local homeless shelters\u2014he could blend in, disappear by day, and come out only under the cover of night. \n\nFor three days, he stayed hidden, blending in with those who lived on the fringes of society. The homeless knew him well. He\u2019d worked with them before, quietly advocating for their rights, and now, they gave him shelter. He helped them when he could, shared a few words of wisdom here and there, but mostly, he kept his head low. He had a plan, a desperate plan.\n\nEach night, he emerged under the cover of darkness, using his stolen identity to buy a one-way train ticket. The destination: Dallas.\n\nHe had to get back to his child, his sick child. The one who had been denied care by the very man he had just slain. Thompson\u2019s empire had refused his child the treatment they so desperately needed. But now, as he boarded the train, his mind was fixed solely on one goal: home. \n\nHis child needed him. Time was running out. He\u2019d fight for them in any way he could.\n\n",

We will keep hearing about his trial and keep getting reminded of what happened.\n\nSo it is in the interest of those who wish to keep their comfy high chair to just bury him in the woods and say he just disappeared. \n\nThe reaction will go from \"OMG he took a shot at the system!\" to \"Dude this guy's a legend he's been evading the US government for years!\".

I grew up in a tough environment\u2014my dad was absent, alcoholic, and abusive.

        "title":"The Flashpoint: A System Crumbling Under Its Own Weight.",
        "selftext":"I just want to share my assessment regarding the assassination of Brian Thompson and what\u2019s to come after. It is more than just a headline\u2014it\u2019s a reflection of the simmering anger that has been boiling under the surface of society for decades. This is not an isolated incident; it\u2019s a symptom of a system built on cruelty, designed to extract wealth and labor from the masses while rewarding a small elite with unimaginable luxury.\n\nAnd yet, this act of violence isn\u2019t the real story\u2014it\u2019s what it represents. It\u2019s about the system Thompson stood for: a healthcare industry that profits from denying care and bankrupting families. UnitedHealthcare, under his leadership, became a symbol of everything wrong with late-stage capitalism\u2014its denial rates among the highest in the industry, its profits built on suffering. The public reaction to his death was not grief or outrage but indifference, even celebration. People shrugged and said, \u201cFAFO.\u201d When the system pushes people to the brink, when it denies them life-saving care, dignity, and basic survival, what else did you expect?\n\nThis is the moment we\u2019ve been heading toward for years. Thompson\u2019s murder is not just an act of desperation\u2014it\u2019s a warning shot, the first visible crack in a dam that has been straining under the weight of exploitation, inequality, and systemic failure.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t just about one man or one company. This is happening alongside the looming shadow of Project 2025, a terrifying roadmap for authoritarian control. It\u2019s happening as the Supreme Court prepares to legitimize healthcare discrimination against trans people, as Trump pushes plans to militarize deportations, and as tariff escalation threatens to devastate working-class families while the rich remain insulated from the fallout. These events aren\u2019t isolated. They\u2019re part of a system designed to concentrate power and wealth in the hands of the few while crushing everyone else underfoot.\n\nFor decades, the ruling class has lived in relative safety, convinced that no one would ever touch them. They\u2019ve lived like fat dogs on their backs, bellies exposed, knowing that their wealth and power shielded them from any meaningful accountability. They\u2019ve built a fortress of media, politics, and propaganda to ensure that the masses remain distracted and divided.\n\nBut now, for the first time in a long time, they are afraid.\n\nThis fear isn\u2019t irrational. They know that anger is growing. They see it in the way people responded to Thompson\u2019s death\u2014not with pity but with indifference, even satisfaction. They see it in the growing calls for solidarity, in the realization that this system isn\u2019t just broken\u2014it\u2019s working exactly as intended, and that intention is to exploit and dehumanize. They see it in the slow but steady awakening of class consciousness, as people begin to understand that their suffering isn\u2019t an accident but a feature of the system.\n\nThis is why Project 2025 exists. It\u2019s a preemptive and calculated strike against the growing resistance. It\u2019s a plan to consolidate executive power, dismantle any remaining checks and balances, and turn federal agencies into tools of corporate and authoritarian control. It\u2019s not subtle\u2014it\u2019s a roadmap for a fascist state. Regulations protecting workers and the environment will be gutted. Marginalized groups will be scapegoated to fracture solidarity. Surveillance and policing will be expanded to crush dissent.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court is laying the legal groundwork for this shift. The upcoming rulings on trans healthcare will do more than just harm trans people\u2014they\u2019ll set a precedent for denying care to anyone the state deems unworthy. This is how it starts: with the most vulnerable, the most marginalized. And once that precedent is set, it expands. First, it\u2019s trans people. Then it\u2019s reproductive healthcare. Then it\u2019s anyone who doesn\u2019t fit neatly into their vision of a \u201cworthy\u201d citizen.\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, Trump\u2019s militarized deportation plans show us exactly how far they\u2019re willing to go. Using the military to rip families apart isn\u2019t about border security\u2014it\u2019s about making a statement. By deploying the military against immigrant families, the government is sending a clear message: no one is safe from state violence. Families will be torn apart, communities will live in fear, and the normalization of military force against civilians will creep closer to reality. It\u2019s not just immigrants who should be worried\u2014this is a test run for broader authoritarian policies.\n\nAs if the social and political crises weren\u2019t enough, the looming tariff escalation is going to push the economy to the brink. These tariffs will drive up the cost of essentials\u2014food, clothing, electronics\u2014making life even harder for families already struggling to get by. Inflation will skyrocket, and the working class will be left to shoulder the burden, while the wealthy continue to hoard their resources and insulate themselves from the consequences. This isn\u2019t just economic mismanagement\u2014it\u2019s deliberate. The chaos created by these policies will be used to justify further austerity measures, cutting social programs and leaving the most vulnerable to fend for themselves. And when the people inevitably protest? The state will have the justification it needs to crack down, using the chaos it created as an excuse for even more repression.\n\nThe media will play its part. Owned by the same billionaires who profit from this system, the media\u2019s job is to keep you distracted, divided, and hopeless. They\u2019ll flood your feeds with nonsense\u2014celebrity scandals, viral distractions, manufactured outrage\u2014to make sure you forget what\u2019s really happening. They\u2019ll pit you against your neighbors, your coworkers, anyone but the people who are actually responsible for your suffering. And social media? The algorithms will amplify the noise, burying any attempt at organizing or solidarity under an avalanche of irrelevant content. The goal is simple: make sure you stay quiet. Make sure you stay afraid. Make sure you forget that the system isn\u2019t inevitable\u2014that it can be challenged, that it can be dismantled.\n\nThis is a critical moment. Thompson\u2019s murder, the response to it, the rise of Project 2025, the SCOTUS rulings, the militarized deportations, the economic collapse\u2014all of these are connected. They are symptoms of a system that is crumbling under its own weight. But the ruling class won\u2019t go quietly. They will fight to maintain their power, to keep us divided and distracted, to ensure that this anger doesn\u2019t turn into action.\n\nOur job is to resist that. To stay focused, to stay angry, to refuse to let them manipulate us into forgetting what\u2019s happening. Class consciousness is their greatest fear because it is our greatest weapon. When we understand that our suffering is not individual but collective, when we see that the system depends on our compliance, that\u2019s when things begin to change.\n\nRevolutions don\u2019t start with perfectly organized movements\u2014they start with moments like this, with cracks in the facade, with the realization that the system is not invincible. The question is whether we will seize this moment, whether we will turn this anger into action, whether we will fight not just to tear down the old but to build something new. This is the flashpoint. The dam is cracking. The time to act is now.",

        "selftext":"# Malevolence of Average Vs Agent of Ethical Entropy\n\nThought I'd share some of my activism while I can; hopefully this helps someone achieve some semblance of higher-learning in the battle of equality and empathy. This is about a years worth of knowledge I've compiled in just one post; consider it an early parting gift.\ud83d\udcda\n\nRemember - only tyrants hate education and free; which this is.\n\n&gt;\n\nThe Harriet Tubman quote, \"I could have saved so many more if they only knew they were slaves,\" resonates deeply with this idea. It reflects the very essence of the challenge faced by the hypersane. Most people are unaware of the cages they\u2019re in, whether those cages are physical, societal, or mental. Samskaras, cognitive dissonance, and the Dunning-Kruger effect all act as mental bonds that keep people from seeing their own chains, much less breaking free from them. Just as Harriet Tubman faced the daunting challenge of liberating those who didn\u2019t realize they needed saving, so too do those who perceive entropy, see its insidious influence, and try to awaken others.\n\nMachines have begun to pass as human, reacting to the reactions of reactions. When artificial intelligence shows more compassion than humanity, such as providing unbiased emotional support or efficiently identifying those in need during crises, it marks a profound defeat for the human race. While AI could be a tool for uplifting marginalized voices, empowering the voiceless, and promoting meaningful art, the average person uses it for trivial purposes\u2014such as sharing cat pictures, creating flashy thumbnails, or other surface-level entertainments that do not contribute to personal growth or societal benefit. These individuals could afford to support indie artists or creators who add value to culture, but choose not to. The apathy towards using advanced tools for meaningful contributions demonstrates a willful negligence of what could be achieved if this powerful technology were wielded for good.\n\nIn contrast, the hypersane use AI to improve themselves, to confront their biases, to challenge their beliefs, and to grow, despite full awareness of the technology's flaws.\u00a0They use AI to educate themselves, to critically analyze their surroundings, and to inspire positive change, knowing that the true potential of technology lies not in mindless entertainment but in meaningful evolution. Meanwhile, average individuals often contribute to societal entropy, remaining complacent and indifferent, perpetuating cycles of ignorance and reinforcing harmful systems. These individuals uphold existing power structures without question, turning a blind eye to injustice and ignoring the potential for greater societal transformation. Yet, majority rule ensures that mediocrity prevails.\n\n# The average individual may avoid homelessness,\u00a0but they will never achieve anything truly ethical or pure in the eyes of consequentialism.\u00a0They live comfortably within the boundaries of societal expectations, never striving to do more, never questioning their actions or the systemic impacts of their choices.\n\nReligion provides a kind of safety within its insular communities, offering emotional comfort and a sense of belonging, but it does nothing to change the empirical reality that many of its followers live unethically while embracing modern idols\u2014such as consumerism, political figures, and social media influencers. The hypocrisy is evident when religious doctrines preach compassion and humility, yet their followers indulge in practices that are inherently selfish or exploitative. This complacency, especially among the average, supports systemic injustices, creating a self-fulfilling cycle where ignorance and harm are normalized. The average person, by failing to challenge these structures, acts as a force for entropy, contributing to the stagnation and degradation of ethical progress. When challenged, the average often reacts with defensiveness, exposing an inherent attachment to mediocrity. Their reaction itself becomes a testament to the comfort they find in conformity and their unwillingness to engage in self-reflection or critical analysis.\n\nThey know nothing of\u00a0henology\u2014the study of the One or the divine unity in\u00a0Neoplatonism\u2014or of the\u00a0Upanishads,\u00a0which are ancient Indian texts that explore spiritual knowledge and the nature of reality. They are unaware of the fact that veganism predates Christianity, or that many of the ethical teachings they follow were borrowed and reinterpreted, often to serve power structures rather than encourage true enlightenment. Christianity itself borrowed heavily from older traditions, misusing those teachings even now\u2014such as the reinterpretation of the Golden Rule, which originally emphasized universal compassion but is often used selectively to justify exclusionary practices. Instead of fostering inclusivity and empathy, it has become a tool to reinforce hierarchies and justify the maltreatment of those deemed 'other.'\n\nIn contrast,\u00a0Jainism\u00a0maintains a consistent commitment to non-violence (ahimsa) and ethical living, demonstrating a dedication to aligning actions with principles, thus highlighting the divergence between practice and principle seen in many other religions. The Jain principle of non-violence extends to all living beings, not just humans, and offers an ethical framework that strives to minimize harm at every level. This consistency is rare and serves as a stark contrast to the selective morality practiced by many other religious groups, where teachings are bent to accommodate convenience or cultural norms.\n\nThese purveyors of ignorance strip children of their autonomy, creating endless cycles of deliberate Choiceful Ignorance\u2014cycles that would make both Sophia, representing divine wisdom in Gnostic traditions, and\u00a0Samsara, the\u00a0cycle\u00a0of birth and suffering in Eastern philosophies, weep for humanity's cruelty and willful ignorance. Children are indoctrinated from a young age into systems that do not serve their well-being but instead prepare them to perpetuate the same harmful cycles their predecessors upheld. The average person, often blind to these cycles, becomes complicit in maintaining them, further ensuring the perpetuation of societal entropy. Insulting the 'average' frequently provokes anger, as many are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable reality of their role in these harmful structures. By their defensive reactions, they inadvertently confirm their position as contributors to these very cycles of ignorance and inaction. The structures that encourage ignorance and apathy thrive because they are left unchallenged by the majority, who are content to live without questioning the deeper purpose or consequences of their actions.\n\nIn an era flooded with data, ignorance is no longer a valid excuse. The availability of information should have led to a more enlightened, more compassionate society. Instead, the average individual has used this abundance of knowledge for superficial gain. People in less privileged nations would fight for the opportunities so casually squandered in the developed world, where access to education, technology, and resources is taken for granted. Yet the average person remains indifferent, content to remain mediocre, unwilling to utilize their privilege for anything greater than fleeting personal pleasure.\n\nThe average individual is a force for entropy, a passive agent of decay in a world that desperately needs growth and renewal. In the context of both ethical and philosophical sciences, entropy is not just a physical phenomenon but also represents a decline in moral and intellectual rigor. Ethical entropy is the degradation of societal values, where complacency leads to the erosion of empathy, justice, and collective progress. Philosophically, entropy reflects the human tendency to default to inertia, to resist change, and to avoid challenging the established order. The average person maintains the status quo by refusing to question it, by failing to see beyond their immediate needs and comforts, thus contributing to both ethical and philosophical decay.\n\n\\---\/------\n\n# Idle-Evil:\n\nThis degradation can be further understood through the concept of 'idle-evil'\u2014the idea that inaction, or the unwillingness to actively confront wrongdoing, is itself a form of malevolence. The average individual's idleness, their passive acceptance of harmful structures, effectively becomes a form of evil. Inaction is action; by choosing not to act, the average perpetuates harm. The forces of entropy thrive not only through those who actively seek to create chaos but also through those who simply do nothing to prevent it. This unwillingness to challenge oneself, to seek deeper truths, or to live ethically results in a collective stagnation, where potential is wasted, and progress is thwarted. It embodies a form of moral entropy that mirrors the second law of thermodynamics\u2014an inevitable drift towards disorder unless intentional actions are taken to reverse it.\n\nThe concept of 'idle-evil' posits that ethical deterioration is accelerated by those who do not actively engage in promoting justice and growth. Just as entropy in physical systems is inevitable without energy input to create order, moral and societal entropy accelerates without active, ethical engagement. The 'average,' by their inaction, fuels the forces of entropy, transforming their passivity into a detrimental force that undermines the ethical foundation of society.\n\nThe hypersane, on the other hand, recognize that the purpose of existence is not to merely exist, but to evolve\u2014to contribute meaningfully to the greater whole and to ensure that one's actions leave the world in a better state than they found it. They see growth as a conscious effort to defy this moral and intellectual entropy by actively seeking higher truths, challenging harmful norms, and dedicating themselves to ethical principles. They understand that entropy can only be countered through deliberate, informed actions that promote renewal, wisdom, and positive change. In this sense, hypersanity is an active rebellion against the natural drift towards decay\u2014a commitment to pursue meaning, responsibility, and ethical evolution, thereby resisting the decline that the average so readily accepts. The hypersane actively choose to reject idle-evil, understanding that even inaction has consequences, and that inaction is itself an ethically significant\u2014and often damaging\u2014choice.\n\nUltimately, the true malevolence of average lies in its quiet acquiescence to systems of power and control. It is the silent acceptance of harm, the refusal to see beyond oneself, and the persistent pursuit of comfort over conscience. The world does not suffer merely because of the actions of the malicious, but because of the inaction of the many. In this age of technology, knowledge, and opportunity, there is no greater tragedy than the choice to remain average\u2014to live a life unexamined, uninspired, and ethically void.\n\n\\---\/----\n\n# Visualizing Entropy for equality:\n\nin a game, debuffs are negative statuses that weaken a character, reduce their effectiveness, or slowly wear them down over time\u2014like being poisoned, slowed, blinded, or having reduced attack power. What makes this analogy so insightful is that entropy works in a very similar way in the real world, but often without us being fully aware of it. It manifests as small obstacles, wear-and-tear, distractions, mental fog, emotional fatigue, habitual patterns, and even societal conditioning\u2014all of which subtly limit our potential, cloud our decision-making, and reduce our ability to take effective action.\n\nWhen these \"entropy debuffs\" are invisible or unrecognized, we operate under their influence without ever realizing it. They might keep us in loops of procrastination, drain our energy over time, or limit our thinking to old, fixed patterns\u2014all without us explicitly noticing. This is why gaining hyper-sanity is so valuable: it\u2019s like equipping a special ability or artifact that lets you\u00a0*see*\u00a0the debuffs. Once you become aware of entropy and its effects, you can start counteracting them, cleansing those debuffs, or adapting strategies to overcome them.\n\nIn gaming, as soon as you know you\u2019ve been poisoned or cursed, you immediately start looking for antidotes or ways to mitigate the effects. The same is true with entropy. Once you become aware of the negative mental, emotional, and physical states that entropy creates, you can actively work on strategies to fight against them. These strategies could be anything from mindfulness and self-reflection, to good habits and meaningful routines, to simply cultivating awareness of the world around you and challenging your own assumptions.\n\nHyper-sanity is like equipping that legendary item that reveals all those hidden debuffs\u2014allowing you to see the bigger picture, become aware of what\u2019s holding you back, and ultimately empower yourself to take action. It's the kind of clarity that\u2019s rare, but incredibly impactful. It doesn\u2019t make the debuffs disappear on its own, but it gives you the awareness and tools to deal with them, to strategize better, and to navigate through the challenges that entropy naturally brings.\n\nJust as in gaming, where success is about knowing the effects on your character and strategizing accordingly, hyper-sanity helps you recognize how entropy affects you so you can actively work against it. In that sense, everyone has the potential to level up their \"game\" in life, to recognize those hidden debuffs of entropy, and to actively work on ways to counterbalance or even transform them into strengths\n\n\\---\/-----\n\n# Ethics of Entropy:\n\nIn ethical terms, entropy manifests as a kind of disordered state between intention and action. It\u2019s that gap where someone\u00a0*intends*\u00a0to be ethical, compassionate, or aware, but, because of conditioning, lack of awareness, or inertia, they continue acting in ways that contradict their values. This is a kind of moral \"slippage,\" and it's often maintained by samskaras\u2014those deeply ingrained mental and emotional impressions that keep us in predictable patterns of thinking and behavior.\n\nFor example, many people might genuinely believe they love animals, but the samskaras of culture, convenience, and habits of diet keep them supporting systems that lead to the suffering of those very animals. Similarly, a person might truly want to support fair labor, yet those habitual patterns, consumer comfort, and lack of awareness keep them buying from brands that exploit people. These behaviors are entropic because they create disharmony between ideals and actions\u2014essentially a kind of moral \"debuff\" that clouds our ability to live ethically aligned lives.\n\nSamskaras act almost like unconscious scripts; they tell us what is \"normal\" or \"acceptable\" based on our past conditioning, even when that conditioning is out of sync with our current awareness or values. The entropy here is the inertia that keeps us stuck\u2014it's easier to continue acting within the well-worn grooves of our past behaviors, even if we logically know there's a better, more ethical way to act.\n\nThe real challenge of reducing this ethical entropy is in gaining awareness\u2014hyper-sanity\u2014that reveals these gaps between our actions and our values. It\u2019s uncomfortable because it forces us to face not just external challenges, but also the inner contradictions and conditioning that hold us back. But once this awareness is achieved, it can no longer be ignored\u2014it\u2019s the proverbial box that, once opened, forever changes our perception.\n\nEthical hyper-sanity means seeing these contradictions clearly and recognizing that if we wish to be truly ethical, we have to actively fight against that entropy. It requires transcending samskaras, disrupting those habitual patterns, and bringing a conscious alignment between what we say we value and how we actually live. This can mean doing the research to avoid supporting slave labor, making dietary choices that reduce harm, or challenging deeply embedded consumer habits\u2014all of which require an awareness and effort to step outside of the convenient but entropic norms.\n\nIn a way, true ethical behavior involves decreasing the entropy in one's life\u2014creating consistency, integrity, and coherence between our beliefs, actions, and the broader impact we have on the world. Samskaras are the entropic forces that bind us to old patterns, and ethical awareness\u2014hyper-sanity\u2014is what allows us to see these patterns, confront them, and create new ones that are in alignment with our highest values.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy because it requires us to push against our conditioning and often against the grain of societal norms. It involves uncomfortable questions, deep self-reflection, and sometimes making changes that aren't immediately convenient. But this is where growth happens\u2014by seeing through the comforting illusions we often hold and making the deliberate effort to act in alignment with the truth we see. Fighting ethical entropy is, therefore, a journey toward reducing the contradictions in our lives and bringing our actions in line with a broader sense of justice, compassion, and wisdom.\u00a0\n\n\\---\/---\n\n# Cognitive Dissonance - a rulers friend:\n\nCognitive dissonance and the Dunning-Kruger effect are central to why many people cannot perceive the full extent of entropy in their lives. Cognitive dissonance is the psychological discomfort experienced when someone\u2019s beliefs, values, or actions are inconsistent with one another. It\u2019s easier to stay in the dark\u2014essentially staying in those comfortable samskaras\u2014because facing the truth of the dissonance forces a person to confront uncomfortable realities and make challenging changes. This dissonance is particularly strong when people hold onto comforting beliefs that are contradicted by evidence. So, to protect their existing worldview, people may ignore, rationalize, or outright reject inconvenient truths, even if those truths are critical for growth.\n\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect further amplifies this problem. It\u2019s the idea that those with limited knowledge or competence in a domain tend to overestimate their understanding or capability\u2014leading to a kind of false certainty. People under the influence of the Dunning-Kruger effect might confidently cling to erroneous beliefs simply because they do not have enough knowledge or awareness to recognize their own limitations. This, combined with cognitive dissonance, makes it extremely challenging for \"the average\" to step outside of their comfort zone and challenge the entropy in their thinking and actions.\n\nWhen someone becomes aware\u2014when they reach a state of hyper-sanity\u2014the typical response is defensiveness, hostility, or mockery. Instead of curiosity, the hypersane individual is often met with ad hominems, straw man arguments, gaslighting, or tribalism. These defensive mechanisms are used because they maintain the comfort of existing beliefs and protect people from the perceived threat of their worldview being shattered.\n\nPlato's Allegory of the Cave is a perfect metaphor for this situation. In the allegory, when the enlightened individual (who has seen the world outside the cave and understood reality) returns to share insight, the prisoners reject and even attack him. They are hostile to the idea of a broader truth because it threatens their established understanding of reality. The shadows they have always known seem safe and familiar, and any disruption to that perceived safety is met with fear and aggression. The hypersane individual is seen as dangerous because they are attempting to show others a truth that demands change\u2014a truth that demands an end to the entropy that keeps them bound.\n\nThe Harriet Tubman quote, \"I could have saved so many more if they only knew they were slaves,\" resonates deeply with this idea. It reflects the very essence of the challenge faced by the hypersane. Most people are unaware of the cages they\u2019re in, whether those cages are physical, societal, or mental. Samskaras, cognitive dissonance, and the Dunning-Kruger effect all act as mental bonds that keep people from seeing their own chains, much less breaking free from them. Just as Harriet Tubman faced the daunting challenge of liberating those who didn\u2019t realize they needed saving, so too do those who perceive entropy, see its insidious influence, and try to awaken others.\n\nThe defensiveness, tribalism, and hostility all stem from a place of fear. To realize one\u2019s own participation in harmful systems, to acknowledge one's own ignorance or complicity, requires a radical self-awareness that not everyone is prepared to embrace. It means dismantling the comfortable narratives built about who we are, about the world, and about our place in it. It requires confronting entropy head-on, which is exhausting, uncomfortable, and often terrifying.\n\nFor many, it is simply easier to stay asleep in the cave, to attack the messenger rather than acknowledge that the shadows on the wall are just illusions. The unfortunate reality is that while hyper-sanity offers a clear view of the world, it often means standing apart, dealing with rejection, and sometimes even hostility from those who are still entrenched in the old patterns.\n\nThis all underscores the deep importance of patience and compassion in trying to bridge that gap\u2014of understanding why people resist the truth and why they cling to their illusions. It\u2019s not because they are inherently \"bad\" or irredeemable but because the structures that maintain their worldview feel so integral to their identity. The journey from ignorance to awareness\u2014from living with entropy to fighting against it\u2014is a hard one. And while not everyone will be ready to take that journey, the persistence of those who have seen the light, who fight entropy and try to help others, is what slowly changes the world.\n\nHyper-sanity is not just an awareness of the external world, but also an empathy for the inner battles others face, and a willingness to engage with those who might not yet be ready to see their own chains. It's the delicate, challenging dance between revealing the truth and holding space for others to eventually see it for themselves, in their own time.\n\nWell, you made it to the end, probably?  \nRemember - only tyrants hate education and free.",

These individuals could afford to support indie artists or creators who add value to culture, but choose not to. The apathy towards using advanced tools for meaningful contributions demonstrates a willful negligence of what could be achieved if this powerful technology were wielded for good.\n\nIn contrast, the hypersane use AI to improve themselves, to confront their biases, to challenge their beliefs, and to grow, despite full awareness of the technology's flaws.\u00a0They use AI to educate themselves, to critically analyze their surroundings, and to inspire positive change, knowing that the true potential of technology lies not in mindless entertainment but in meaningful evolution. Meanwhile, average individuals often contribute to societal entropy, remaining complacent and indifferent, perpetuating cycles of ignorance and reinforcing harmful systems. These individuals uphold existing power structures without question, turning a blind eye to injustice and ignoring the potential for greater societal transformation. Yet, majority rule ensures that mediocrity prevails.\n\n# The average individual may avoid homelessness,\u00a0but they will never achieve anything truly ethical or pure in the eyes of consequentialism.\u00a0They live comfortably within the boundaries of societal expectations, never striving to do more, never questioning their actions or the systemic impacts of their choices.\n\nReligion provides a kind of safety within its insular communities, offering emotional comfort and a sense of belonging, but it does nothing to change the empirical reality that many of its followers live unethically while embracing modern idols\u2014such as consumerism, political figures, and social media influencers. The hypocrisy is evident when religious doctrines preach compassion and humility, yet their followers indulge in practices that are inherently selfish or exploitative. This complacency, especially among the average, supports systemic injustices, creating a self-fulfilling cycle where ignorance and harm are normalized. The average person, by failing to challenge these structures, acts as a force for entropy, contributing to the stagnation and degradation of ethical progress. When challenged, the average often reacts with defensiveness, exposing an inherent attachment to mediocrity. Their reaction itself becomes a testament to the comfort they find in conformity and their unwillingness to engage in self-reflection or critical analysis.\n\nThey know nothing of\u00a0henology\u2014the study of the One or the divine unity in\u00a0Neoplatonism\u2014or of the\u00a0Upanishads,\u00a0which are ancient Indian texts that explore spiritual knowledge and the nature of reality. They are unaware of the fact that veganism predates Christianity, or that many of the ethical teachings they follow were borrowed and reinterpreted, often to serve power structures rather than encourage true enlightenment. Christianity itself borrowed heavily from older traditions, misusing those teachings even now\u2014such as the reinterpretation of the Golden Rule, which originally emphasized universal compassion but is often used selectively to justify exclusionary practices. Instead of fostering inclusivity and empathy, it has become a tool to reinforce hierarchies and justify the maltreatment of those deemed 'other.'\n\nIn contrast,\u00a0Jainism\u00a0maintains a consistent commitment to non-violence (ahimsa) and ethical living, demonstrating a dedication to aligning actions with principles, thus highlighting the divergence between practice and principle seen in many other religions. The Jain principle of non-violence extends to all living beings, not just humans, and offers an ethical framework that strives to minimize harm at every level. This consistency is rare and serves as a stark contrast to the selective morality practiced by many other religious groups, where teachings are bent to accommodate convenience or cultural norms.\n\nThese purveyors of ignorance strip children of their autonomy, creating endless cycles of deliberate Choiceful Ignorance\u2014cycles that would make both Sophia, representing divine wisdom in Gnostic traditions, and\u00a0Samsara, the\u00a0cycle\u00a0of birth and suffering in Eastern philosophies, weep for humanity's cruelty and willful ignorance. Children are indoctrinated from a young age into systems that do not serve their well-being but instead prepare them to perpetuate the same harmful cycles their predecessors upheld. The average person, often blind to these cycles, becomes complicit in maintaining them, further ensuring the perpetuation of societal entropy. Insulting the 'average' frequently provokes anger, as many are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable reality of their role in these harmful structures. By their defensive reactions, they inadvertently confirm their position as contributors to these very cycles of ignorance and inaction. The structures that encourage ignorance and apathy thrive because they are left unchallenged by the majority, who are content to live without questioning the deeper purpose or consequences of their actions.\n\nIn an era flooded with data, ignorance is no longer a valid excuse. The availability of information should have led to a more enlightened, more compassionate society. Instead, the average individual has used this abundance of knowledge for superficial gain. People in less privileged nations would fight for the opportunities so casually squandered in the developed world, where access to education, technology, and resources is taken for granted. Yet the average person remains indifferent, content to remain mediocre, unwilling to utilize their privilege for anything greater than fleeting personal pleasure.\n\nThe average individual is a force for entropy, a passive agent of decay in a world that desperately needs growth and renewal. In the context of both ethical and philosophical sciences, entropy is not just a physical phenomenon but also represents a decline in moral and intellectual rigor. Ethical entropy is the degradation of societal values, where complacency leads to the erosion of empathy, justice, and collective progress. Philosophically, entropy reflects the human tendency to default to inertia, to resist change, and to avoid challenging the established order. The average person maintains the status quo by refusing to question it, by failing to see beyond their immediate needs and comforts, thus contributing to both ethical and philosophical decay.\n\n",

        "selftext":"This essay was written in response to those questioning the value of using the state's own artifices as a battleground. Although this essay does not provide a perfect solution, It can hopefully serve as the basis of illuminating discussion.\n\nAlthough a majority of the internet is commodified and serves to reinforce this paradigm, this is not an intrinsic condition of the internet. But a product of the culture in which the internet was discovered. Though websites like Facebook and eBay will continue to exist, since they serve both as expedients and abstractions of social phenomena already occurring within a culture, their existence does not preclude other designs.\n\nThere is nothing stopping someone from establishing an alternative network whose design accounts for different parameters. Our problem is not due to constraints of the medium. Its potential is only confined by the boundaries of our minds. Heinously, mental limits are reinforced by prevailing themes in culture, the existence of shackling symbols, and what Situationists deemed the Spectacle.\n\nIt will only be through confronting these artifices that new methods and potentials will emerge. Till we fight far enough, we will unfortunately be fighting blind, but this does not make the fight less noble. Making the conceit that I too am a product of my time, I propose one method of moving forward.\n\nThe deployment of capsule sites within corporate space. If a website can be defined as one or more webpages of related content identified by a common domain name, a capsule site is a meta-structure built within the confines of existing domains, though not bound to them, that can be navigated by some means, allowing it to be interfaced with as if it were a website within itself.\n\nThe structure is not given shape by a common domain but by the connections between individual nodes. Capsule sites can be built with hyperlinks or hashtags; as long as there is a means of navigating from one node to another, it is possible to launch a capsule site. But how is the structure useful?\n\nImagine an eco-activist campaign. The goal is to spread awareness of and garner support for legislation protecting the planet. To gain traction, the activists first decide to target three companies with large carbon footprints. They prioritize these social media accounts, not only because of their environmental impact but also because of their large followings. The activists then choose a hashtag for their action campaign. For instance, they choose #GreenToday29.\n\nThis is done to connect the nodes to a unique handle, forming a network. They then generate content typical of campaigns of their type \u2014 infographics, art, etc. \u2014 and deploy them on the target pages. In effect, they have created a campaign website within the social media accounts of these brands, successfully subverting the space while also increasing their cause\u2019s exposure by capitalizing on those brands\u2019s existing audiences.\n\nThis guerrilla approach to creating networks using existing domains can be applied to numerous campaigns and projects. Through the intelligent deployment of capsule sites, we can not only succeed in organizing and executing direct action, but also radically reorganize the way we navigate the web.",

        "selftext":"I\u2019m moving to a small town in the UK soon, and I don\u2019t know anyone there yet. From what I\u2019ve read, the town seems to have a somewhat progressive, left-leaning vibe, which makes me think it could be a good place to start an **offline anarchist reading group**.\n\nHere\u2019s the idea:\n\nThe group would collectively decide on a book (related to anarchism, probably non-fiction, but open to the group\u2019s input). We\u2019d meet every week or two for about an hour to discuss a chapter or 50ish pages. It is a slow reading for sure, but this pacing works well because it\u2019s flexible \u2014 people can miss a meeting and still jump back in without losing the thread. It usually takes 4\u20135 meetings to finish a book.\n\nIn a previous online group I was part of (the one that got me into anarchism!), we read and discussed works by David Graeber, James C. Scott, Silvia Federici, Frantz Fanon, etc. It was a great experience \u2014 not just for engaging with anarchist thought, but also for practicing collective organizing in a small way.\n\nMy plan so far is either to post about the group online or maybe put up flyers in spots like pubs, cafes, or record shops with bulletin boards with local events. But I\u2019m also nervous about turnout \u2014 either too few people showing up or the wrong kind of attention (someone looking to disrupt).\n\nSo, I wanted to reach out here for advice:\n\nHave you run or joined a similar group, either online or offline?\n\nWhat worked well for you in terms of organizing and outreach?\n\nHow did you navigate potential challenges (like low turnout or disruptive participants)?\n\nI\u2019d also love to hear if this post inspires anyone else to start something similar. I think small, local groups like this are a great introduction to anarchist literature and an opportunity to experiment with collective practices.\n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts or advice!",

        "selftext":"There has been some criticism lodged against us. Claims have been made that our activism is merely engagement. That our movement is sort of sofa ersatz activism. However, in order for this argument to hold true, you must make a central conceit. That the concrete world is somehow more real than the digital. Members of The Kollectiv do not view the net from this narrow scope. We see the digital realm as an extension of the more abstract plain of technology. We see the space, though incorporeal on a macroscale, to be very real.\n\nThe average user in 2024, spent a 1\/5th of their life online. Whether engaging with shopping, posting, or just browsing the net this is a significant portion of time. Enough time is spent on the net that a culture has emerged around various social media sites. Artifacts are made that can only be interacted with in the digital space. And people can become totally enmeshed in a digital world if they wish. Interacting with the greater world almost exclusively in the digital realm.\u00a0\n\nAn extreme example would be an individual who works as a digital nomad, does all their shopping online, and interacts with others exclusively through social media. Although this individual would be seen to be living a fringe net lifestyle, this way of life is very possible. To argue that activism should not be done through the medium of technology is only alienating. It does not serve one's greater purpose. 64% of the world is online. That is 5.52 billion souls.\u00a0\n\nThough The Kollectiv adopts a view of the internet separate from those informed by commodity and corporate interest, the economic activity on the net can\u2019t be ignored. Imagine the disruptive potential of a boycott. The sheer volume of activity allows the activist to make lasting change on the world. We can look back to The Gamestop Short Squeeze. A grassroots political action originating in Wallstreets Bets. To go further back in history we can make reference to the initiatives of net.artists. Groups such as the VNS created works like the \u201cA Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st Century\u201d. Work like this advanced both feminism and digital art. To write off the digital landscape as a lesser landscape of reform, activism, and engaging art, one would have to ignore the efficacy of these movements.\u00a0\n\nGoing further into the political landscape we can look at the example set by Net Strike. A software that was deployed by activists in the 90\u2019s for digital sit ins. It essentially was a tool for groups to orchestrate DDOS attacks. A vector of protest, that has unfortunately been taken from the general public and is now deployed heinously by state actors to suppress movements. This reversal if anything shows that net activism should be more staunchly defended. The internet is now often the first point of contact individuals have with any movement. And it is also the center of global operations. Are rights on the net should be defended, advanced, and clearly defined. The right to protest should not just extend to the physical space, when the digital space is becoming such a driving factor in our lives.\n\nThe Kollectiv\u2019s digital graffiti campaign and its current food disparity initiative is only the beginning. We plan on continuing to mobilize people to be the change they want to see in the world. By establishing our ad hoc hyperlink structure: essentially a website built within the framework of another. We will be raising awareness for our cause. Making people think about the effects of food disparity, while considering new ways to experience the internet. Are either of these aims ignoble? I do not believe so.\n\n\u00a0We are continuing in the footsteps of activists such as The Electro Hippies. Advancing methods of protest into the 21st Century. We are also continuing the efforts of situationist thinkers. Now that globalism taken home and the internet has pushed commodity and spectacle into our home. We must attack it at its source if liberty is to continue to flourish and grow for future generations.\n\n\u00a0To ignore the possibilities of change now is rob the children of the future of their potential fruit. That is why I continue to call for the development of\u00a0[net.art](http:\/\/net.art\/)\u00a0and methods of activism on the web. Not only to raise awareness for causes affecting us here and now, but to change the landscape of the internet for the people of the future.",

I realize that this is a tall order but I want to hear your thoughts.\n\n[Full disclosure I'm going to write up the best ideas I find, here &amp; elsewhere, in my blog @\n\n https:\/\/open.substack.com\/pub\/radicalpraxis\n\nI'll message people individually to ask if they want to be credited &amp; if so how.]",

        "selftext":"\nIt\u2019s time to fight back - not with fists or fire, but with strategy, wit, and relentless resolve. The battle has begun, and we\u2019ve been sitting idle too long.\n\nNo more appeasement. No more hand-wringing and woe is me. That era is over.  \n\nBecause now, and you know who I'm referring to when I say it, they\u2019re shouting the quiet part out loud.  We\u2019ve seen this movie already and - SPOILER ALERT - it gets two big fat fucking thumbs down. \n\nThis is an existential crisis - cultural, societal, and moral. No amount of politeness or compromise will fix it. Change must be decisive, sharp, and unrelenting.\n\nWe operate under the ethos of \u201cChaotic Good\u201d \u2014 ethically grounded, but willing to bend conventions to achieve a just and necessary outcome. This isn\u2019t about playing fair. It\u2019s about playing to win.\n\nThe Plan\n\nWe start by undermining their narratives - turning their propaganda into bloated caricatures of itself. Amplify their contradictions, highlight their hypocrisies, and watch as their house of cards teeters. Social media isn\u2019t just a platform; it\u2019s a battlefield. Use it. Inject doubt, expose flaws, and disrupt their echo chambers with precision and intent.\n\nThen, we isolate their safe spaces\u2014their disinformation dens, where they gather to reinforce their delusions. These are the breeding grounds of their smug certainty and obscene bloviation We dismantle them with ridicule, fact, complete situational awareness, unrelenting inspection and unpredictable strategic disruption.\n\nThe Offensive\n\nWe emerge from the shadows and go on the offensive. Divide and discredit. Target those who thrive on borrowed ideas and hollow convictions. Ridicule, though sharp, is an effective tool\u2014it cuts through their self-assured veneer and forces introspection or isolation.\n\nWe laugh. We mock. We hone cruelty to a fine point, and turn it upon to those who would do the the same, only against the defenseless or weak. We use it as a weapon against the arrogance that blinds them.\n\nTheir hubris is our opportunity. They\u2019ve grown too comfortable in their echo chambers, where dissent is manufactured and managed, and where doubt is shouted down and dismissed. But echo chambers collapse under pressure. By sowing discord through deception and double agency, we begin to re-shape the narrative and further weaken the tenuous, hierarchical power structure. Decision making slows. Informational logistics become crippled. Mistrust breeds infighting. Infighting breeds collapse.\n\nThe Results\n\nHistory has proven that this works. Figures who seemed untouchable crumble under the weight of their own avarice, narcissism, loyalty-before-competence and confidence-before-evidence. When doubt creeps in, and extrinsic value is foolishly assumed equivalent to its intrinsic counterpart, the inner circle of \"trust\" is breached, and the Laura Loomers of the world must be sacrificed to repair the damage. Ejected, unceremoniously and with malicious intent. It\u2019s a matter of when, not if.\n\nWhen their backs are against the wall, their true nature will be revealed. They\u2019ll either flee or fight, but either way, they lose. Cowards flee and become the weak, thus high-value prey to their morally bankrupt militant brethren.  They eventually, unavoidably consume themselves,  becoming the ouroboros - the snake which eats itself - and starting the cycle anew.  Starting it under a benevolent but in this case what absolutely must be a highly vigilant new regime. \n\nThe Mission\n\nThis isn\u2019t about abandoning moral principles - it\u2019s about weaponizing them. Evidence, facts, wisdom, and truth are our greatest tools. With them, we don\u2019t just dismantle ignorance; we eradicate it.\n\nThe stakes are high. The outcome is just. And the time is now.\n\nNo mercy for the wicked, justice for the victims, balance and reason back to our society. \n",

        "selftext":"Hello again!\n\nThis is my second piece to a long history series detailing anarchic and libertarian tendencies in China. In this piece I discuss two very unknown thinkers outside of East Asia - Mozi and Yangzi.\n\nThe former was the founder of a rival school to Confucianism, whose members formed a highly disciplined cadre of activists, going so far as to defend cities to the death for their ideals. The Mohists also developed logic, universalism, consequentialism, siege defense, and a concept of Mutual Aid, the ideas of which influence activists and Chinese\/East\/Southeast Asian mutual aid networks. Some brief comparisons to Sergei Nechayev and an analysis of their praxis follows, with many sources and footnotes for the more curious to follow. \n\nThe latter thinker, Yang Zhu, is a mysterious person who never wrote down his thoughts. However, based upon our circumstantial evidence, it seems he was a genuine individualist, whose ideas radically questioned and rejected the state, one of the first ever in history to do so. His ideas have anachronistically been labeled Daoist, and he almost certainly influenced Zhuangzi. I do a comparison with his ideas to Stirner and settle the possibility of his influence upon Stirner (no influence it appears). This then is the latest comparison of Egoist and Yangist thought that may be of interest to Anarchists today. \n\nThe influence of these two figures is hard to convey given how unknown they are, but many of the anarchic tendencies we eventually see in Confucianism and Daoism originate in these two thinkers. \n\nThe next piece in the series will dive into Daoism, the Daodejing, Ursula K. Le Guin's bastardized translation of it, and analyzing how \"anarchist\" the Daodejing actually is. \n\nI would appreciate a read and would love to answer any questions people have. \n\nHere's the link: \n[https:\/\/medium.com\/@1over0equalsundefined\/uncovering-chinese-anarchy-part-2-mohist-activism-and-yangzis-individualism-d55867a64bf2](https:\/\/medium.com\/@1over0equalsundefined\/uncovering-chinese-anarchy-part-2-mohist-activism-and-yangzis-individualism-d55867a64bf2)\n",

They were all M\u0101ori and their chief spoke to me early on and said that we (Kai\u0101whina and the M\u0101ori wardens) had the authority here and that they would just give us back up if anything got out of hand but that they weren\u2019t expecting that at all. They were really respectful and hands-off. Every now and then the chief would ask me if I\u2019d got a second and give me an update from his comms about where things were getting blocked once people had moved out of our area etc. They were great to work alongside. It was really refreshing and exactly the kind of police you\u2019d want at a h\u012bkoi if you have to have them there at all.\n\n\n\n\"I saw a beautiful moment with the police chief and a tamariki M\u0101ori \\[M\u0101ori child\\] about 4 years old. His mum had come and asked if the kid could shake the cop\u2019s hand. The cop took off his hat, got down on his knees, had a hongi with the tamariki, shook his hand and gave him a high-five. The little boy was all lit up and the cop was really moved and thanked the mum. More of this kind of policing please!\"\n\n\n\n\"I saw one Maori wahine \\[M\u0101ori woman\\] police officer and a Maori warden helping a young Maori wahine over the bridge, the youngster was a bit distraught, not unwell, maybe a bit overcome with emotion. I asked the Maori Warden and Wahine Maori officer with her if I could assist the distraught young person, too. The police officer said, ' kao Papa, we okay, we going to walk our friend to Curran St, we will be okay, she will be okay.' I had a lot of respect for this officer and her words and her actions, protecting our young sister, something Kaiawhina do too.\"",

There may or may not be massive mobilizations by then, most likely not IMO given the current silence in the streets. In either case, Trump will hit the ground running, hard. It is absolutely clear at this point that the first targets will likely be immigrant communities; I would imagine that he has been planning the massive promised community raids for quite awhile now (2018 family separation was already being piloted secretly in 2017) and will be quite capable in deploying federal, state, local, and possibly paramilitary forces into the streets to shock and awe and confuse and terrorize. I also foresee spectacular shutdowns at the border, perhaps in combination with a spectacular migrant \"crisis\" (DHS has been stage-managing the border for awhile now IMO.)Left and community forces will likely intervene to counter these raids on the ground which, combined with likely police brutality at anti-Trump and pro-Palestine actions, will likely lead to a spiral of spectacular violence. This will then give Trump the excuse he needs to begin spectacular crackdowns on opposition. Beyond the legal apparatus- outlawing \"antifa\" as a domestic terrorist \"organization,\" reviving criminal anarchy statutes, immunizing vigilante violence, and deploying the Insurrection Act (including suspension of habeas corpus)- Trump can respond in both bold and subtle ways. Subtly, he will deploy the security agency apparatuses to surgically dismember the already weak\/nonexistent resistance. Spectacularly, he will likely IMO launch a massacre at some point- government forces firing into a crowd, Kent State on a massive scale. At which point, I predict all overt resistance will be finished for quite awhile and he can begin his crusading fascist transformation of society while simultaneously dismantling the official opposition in the Democrats. This could all happen in a matter of a couple weeks IMO (the Palestinian encampment spectacle barely lasted three months.)My questions to the community are the following. How likely do you see this scenario? What might be different? And most importantly, how do we not fall into these traps? How do we resist overtly without falling into a crushing response of violence and repression? How do we resist subtly without being marginalized and dismembered in the shadows? How do we visibly connect and grow with the masses ready for leadership under these harsh conditions? Can we avoid moving to underground and armed resistance at this point?\n\nP.S. The recent Crimethinc post about assemblies on this subreddit got me thinking, too.  Is a strategy of bottom up rapid, public, democratic mobilization a viable counter-strategy in the current conjuncture?  What might that look like right now in the U.S.?  We saw attempts at this in 2017 with neighborhood assemblies, etc. with mixed to negative results.  What went right, what went wrong then?  Genuinely curious thoughts here.",

To those of you that read this and said \"wow. thank you, ill take it back up.\" THANK YOU. it means more than i can say. thank you for feeding the flame of will to keep trying in my heart. You couldve been defenzive and doubled down but you didnt. I admittedly was very anxious to post this despite how angry i likely come off. Its scary to speak on something really important to you. EDIT END.\n\nYeah im going to be an impolite uppity cripple.\n\nYou want to resist the state? Wear a mask.\n\nYou want to physically protect yourself and your community members? Wear a mask.\n\nYou want to be in solidarity with vulnerable populations, including the disabled? Wear. a. mask.\n\nThis isnt moral performing or some kind of conspiratorial distraction from other issues or whatever (which i have been accused of. sorry for wanting my life to be valued and included in organizing! so sorry!) . Im writing this because its important to me, because disabled grief and rage should be heard, and im sick honestly, not only physically as a cripple but mentally of seeing a majority of the people who claim to be against the right and against physical violence to minority groups willingly enact it every fucking day. The amount of ableism among the left is buck fucking wild. But its because undoing our oppressive mindsets takes active work and effort. Labeling ourself left does not absolve any of us of the white supremacist mindsets we all have to undo.\n\nAnd i wonder if part of it is because being covid cautious isnt glorious; it is tiring, it is exhausting, it is something you have to commit to thinking about and showing up for. It isnt one beautiful act of revolution. It becomes a daily part of your life. It is a responsibility. You get no immediate reward. Can you handle that? can you actually, really handle that and do it? can you try? or will we continue to leave the oppressed to handle their oppression on their own, reinforcing the individualist mindset that atomizes us further and facilitates mass death?\n\nCovid denial, anti-masking, anti-vaxxing has been an ostensibly right wing politic from the start. But somehow its all okay now. Because we all want to go back to \"normal\". Well this isnt normal. Kids going back to school and spreading covid isnt normal. People (including children) developing [long term incurable disease](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41579-022-00846-2) from repeated infection isnt normal. Deciding that a body ravaging disease is \"here to stay\" and yet not using or implementing (even at LEAST publicly, like in hospitals, schools, grocery...) [\\*any\\* of the tools we know work and have to combat it](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/volumes\/70\/wr\/mm7027e1.htm) is not normal. (its like saying \"HIV is here to stay\" and then not using any protection, denying any science or education about it, not getting tested, and for the sake of argument the only vaccines are ones that still allow it to spread. does that make any actual sense to you?)\n\nYour cognitive dissonance will not save you from the work that needs to be done. You could be doing something to change your immediate environment and challenge violence and eugenics \\*right now\\*. If you arent, why? What will it take to get leftists to take this shit seriously and continue to speak up about it? No where has any science in all of the global community said \"covid is over\". The person who declared that was Biden. Are you going to take your fucking advice from the guy who caught it like five fucking times and has ostensible cognitive and physical decline? Sure, you could say \"hes just old\", but we know enough about how long covid affects people of all ages that it is not out of the realm of possibility **at all** to say that thats at least part of why hes so sick now.\n\nTLDR: Covid isnt over. Covid denial is a right wing politic. When you dont wear a mask and do what you can to fight this disease, you are complicit in eugenics. Disabled people should not have to stay inside and live in fear, because no one wants to do their part in being \\*collectively\\* responsible for communicable disease. **Get curious, be brave, start these conversations with your leftist groups**, and [***Wear a fucking mask.***](https:\/\/cleanairoly.org\/maskzine\/HowToChooseAMaskEZine.pdf)\n\n[ADDRESSING COMMON COVID MISCONCEPTIONS](https:\/\/youhavetoliveyour.life\/)\n\nim not taking any shit from people in the comments. If you feel guilt, shame or whatever in response to seeing this, thats your responsibility. Ive been in community with some of the smartest, kindest folks i know about this shit.

        "title":"So should we prepare for a massive civil war under the Trump administration? What do you think is going to look like? I'm imagining some return of the occupy movement with far more intensity",
        "selftext":"Alright, I\u2019m really curious to hear from y\u2019all: how likely do you think it is that we\u2019d see a civil war if Trump gets a second term? It feels like everything is just more tense and divided than ever, and a lot of people seem to think things could actually get violent. What do you think? Here are some reasons why it might happen\u2026and why it might not.\n\nWhy a Civil War Could Actually Happen:\n\n1. Intense Political Divisions: We\u2019re seeing deeper rifts than we\u2019ve had in a long time. A Trump comeback would probably push those divides even further. Issues like immigration, gun control, and voting rights already have people on edge. With Trump back in the White House, it\u2019s hard to say how much worse things could get.\n\n\n2. Rise of Armed Groups and Radicalization: Let\u2019s be real\u2014militias and far-right groups have gotten way more organized and vocal. If Trump\u2019s back, these groups might feel empowered and ready to act. There\u2019s a risk they\u2019d see opposition as a threat and respond with force.\n\n\n3. Economic Pressures: The economy is already rough for a lot of people, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be getting better anytime soon. Another Trump term could bring more instability. If people feel like they\u2019re being pushed out of the economy or losing their jobs, that frustration could boil over.\n\n\n4. Loss of Trust in Institutions: There\u2019s already so much distrust in institutions, from the FBI to the courts. If people see the government as illegitimate or \u201cout to get them,\u201d we could see more groups taking things into their own hands.\n\n\n\nWhy We Might Avoid It:\n\n1. Lack of Organized Movement: While there\u2019s a ton of division, there isn\u2019t really a clear or unified movement on either side. People are angry, but without some kind of structured leadership or purpose, it\u2019s hard to imagine a full-scale civil war breaking out.\n\n\n2. People Like Stability: Even those who are fed up with the system still depend on it for basic things. Whether it\u2019s job security, paying bills, or just the routines of everyday life, a lot of people don\u2019t want to risk that for the unknown.\n\n\n3. Government Crackdown on Dissent: The government has a huge police force, the National Guard, and other ways to shut things down quickly. If it comes to it, they\u2019ve got the power to put out fires before they spread.\n\n\n\nWould the Military Split?\n\nCould the military fracture in all this? It\u2019s possible. A lot of soldiers have personal beliefs and backgrounds that could influence them if things got bad. Here are a few reasons why the military might not stay united:\n\nPolitical Divides: Some in the ranks might feel loyalty to Trump, while others might not. If Trump has strong support in the military, it could create splits between those who\u2019d follow him directly and those who\u2019d follow orders from higher up.\n\nPersonal Ethics: If things got messy and soldiers were ordered to act against civilians, some might refuse on moral grounds. They may feel like they\u2019re caught between duty and their conscience.\n\nCommunity Ties: A lot of soldiers are deeply connected to their home communities. If things get chaotic back home, they might feel torn between military orders and staying loyal to where they came from.\n\n\nWhat do you think? Is there a real chance of things going this far, or are we too dependent on the current system to let it all go up in flames?\n\n",

        "selftext":"I've been thinking about this over the past week or so and I'm wondering if I'm offbase. Please let me know if you think so.\n\nA genocide, say the Holocaust or the Palestinian Genocide, is more than merely one group of people annihilating another. It is a mark against all humanity that we collectively let it happen. By recognizing it as a genocide, we say, \"it is a stain against humanity that this occurred, and we all share the burden of never allowing it to happen again.\" Even though I did not support Israel personally, what did I do to, exactly, to stop it? Couldn't we all have done more? Shouldn't we continue to do all we can?\n\nI feel that now that so many people who were alive during the Holocaust are now dead, our collective memory no longer carries the weight of just how colossally evil it was. Many folks, even if they recognize it as such, may simply hold the Germans entirely responsible, or perhaps the rest of Europe for allowing it to happen too. But I firmly believe it remains a yoke upon all people, no matter their direct role in it. By saying it was just this or that group's fault, we diminish it and weaken our ability to prevent it happening again.\n\nI have also come to think of a country's descent into fascist dictatorship the same way. No, I don't blame the people of Tonga for helping put a fascist into office on the other side of the planet. But is it not a stain on all humanity when this happens? Is it not a reflection of the worst of all we are? And should it not be an equal warning to all mankind to resist the twin evils of greed and apathy, under which almost all evils devised by people could be categorized?\n\nI look at the left blaming the DNC and liberals for Trump's victory, and Dems blaming pretty much everyone. But this was a collective loss: it is to the detriment of the entire human race and therefore we must all shoulder responsibility, reflect on how we let things get to this point, and ask ourselves how we can eliminate fascist tendencies root and stem. We owe it to future generations to take this responsibility.\n\nI regret that I have waited so long in my life to commit to mutual aid and strengthening ties to our local community. I hope current events help snap many others out of their apathy or nihilism, and commit to helping others and bringing happiness to those around them. That's how we can really start to change things for the better.",

Since 1945, the republicans where mostly silent on what they did in the middle eas or in other countries that where not of america interest. Sutch as Bush in Iraq, Eisenhower 1954 Guatemalan coup etc.. When covid happened, It was easier for far-right to put the blame on minorities sutch as trans people or immigraints than ever before, because people are angry. Also a lot of terrible people also are justifying their bigotry that they held in for so long, because of the economic decline and far-right in power. I see similarities to nazi Germany. In my opinon since 1945 the people in a west turned a blind eye on far-right, because they thought fascism would never happen and resurface of more hateful far-right is impossible. When in reality, they always held power just more silently waiting for to be more hateful and nobody did anything with it. Liberals and we as a people didn't learn anything from nazi Germany.

Maybe you don't want to join an existing group, maybe you want to do something till you find them, maybe there are no groups in your area. This is for you.\n\n Hopefully you'll find something useful in here, take what is interesting to you and feel free to ignore the rest. If any of the links peak your interest then dig around the website a little. They are resources to be used. \n\n\u00a0There is an actual loosely connected international anarchist movement.

I recommend starting with the NYC Anarchist Black Cross guide to writing letters. \n\nhttps:\/\/uprisingsupport.org\/further-resources\/ \n\nThe uprising support site has a list of prisoners from 2020, the NYC ABC site has mostly longer term political prisoners and there are other groups as well. \n\n There are also many different directions you can take prisoner support. Books through Bars is great!\n\nhttps:\/\/prisonbookprogram.org\/prisonbooknetwork\/\n\n-Start a phone tree to respond to ICE raids-\n\n This must be done carefully and with a strong understanding of what is being asked, but if your community is affected by raids or has reason to believe that you will be it's better to have those conversations now.\n\n-Support the International Anti-Fascist Defense Fund-\n\nBuy a T-shirt, set up a benefit show, tell your friends about it. Find a way to support that works for you. They do good work and if you donate you get all the annoying emails where people hash out minute details of who gets support from the fund. Hahaha.\n\nhttps:\/\/intlantifadefence.wordpress.com\/\n\n-Translation\/transcription\/Interpretation work-\n\nMany groups struggle to organize in multiple languages and this is vital, especially for crossing class boundaries and international borders. Reach out to anarchist groups that you appreciate and offer what you can. Translate texts with your friends and post them online!\n\nGetting solid info from anarchist groups across the globe is great.\n\nMultiple anarchist libraries are looking for help getting off the ground or expanding their text selections.\n\nhttps:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/special\/index\n\n-Table local shows-\n\n Take those zines we talked about in part 2. Get a table. Go to a show (ask permission first if needed) put zines on to the table and talk to people about them. Curate the table to make sense for the situation.\n\n-Volunteer at your local anarchist bookstore-\n\nDo you live in\/near a city? There is a decent chance there is a radical bookstore there. They frequently have volunteering opportunities. You can learn how a collective works and all the boring details people leave out. Here are a few. \n\n Philadelphia  https:\/\/woodenshoebooks.org\/ Seattle  https:\/\/leftbankbooks.com\/ Baltimore  https:\/\/redemmas.org\/ Vancouver BC https:\/\/spartacusbooks.net\/\n\n-Put up posters, make art, stickers, banners, etc-\n\n This can also be a good way to build trust and skills with others that can be used in other situations. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.sproutdistro.com\/catalog\/zines\/direct-action\/banner-drops-stencils-wheatpaste\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.sproutdistro.com\/catalog\/zines\/direct-action\/billboard-improvement\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.sproutdistro.com\/catalog\/zines\/direct-action\/field-guide-wheatpasting\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.sproutdistro.com\/catalog\/zines\/direct-action\/walls-are-alive\/\n\n-Learn how to research your local fash\/pigs-\n\nThe fascist movement has shifted focus pretty hard the last 4 years. While we might end up with PBs back in the street soon, most likely fash will continue to be organizing at school board meetings, anti-homeless groups, in police departments and the republican party. We have done a good job spreading antifash cultural signifiers, but not practices as the far right street movement was defeated.\n\nhttps:\/\/cospringsantifa.noblogs.org\/resources\/\n\nhttps:\/\/threewayfight.org\/\n\n-Do you rent?

Importantly, they're doing it in an autonomy-focused way that should interest anarchists. In particular, the section of this article titled *Changing the whole framework* discusses the shift in Indian Country from enforced dependency on the U.S. federal government to a home rule, tribal digital sovereignty perspective. Against the backdrop of longstanding, ongoing injustices against Indigenous people, this article discusses what improved internet access on tribal lands might mean as the grass-touching, mutual aid-style bootcamps meet the selfie-driven, AI spam-clogged dystopia of today's internet.

        "selftext":"I'm honestly frustrated that, in an era where we have apps to find people for casual sex or to sell secondhand items, we still don\u2019t have a widely accessible global platform for mutual aid (not just for money), something where people can connect locally and offer or receive support for essential needs of all kinds. (Plus, the low engagement and interest to push ideas like that, while some stupid leftist memes online get 2k engagement and likes.)\n\nWe have the technology for instant connections, yet no coordinated platform for the working class, disabled individuals, or anyone needing assistance with daily problems people face. Imagine if there was an app that made it as easy to find a volunteer for grocery shopping, help with transportation, or skill-sharing as it is to find a used couch or a date. Instead, we have communities full of people needing support and others willing to offer it, but no accessible way to bring them together.\n\nSome might argue that funding such a platform would be the main challenge, but I\u2019m not convinced that\u2019s the biggest issue. We see individuals crowdfunding significant amounts of money on platforms like GoFundMe all the time. Plus, with the collective strength of leftist communities, crowdfunding and mutual aid for setup and upkeep costs (like server hosting) would be achievable if the right people coordinated it.\n\nWhat we really need is for IT professionals who are committed to mutual aid to offer their skills voluntarily to put this idea into practice and I refusd to believe there are no leftist ITers out there (in particular cause so many people in IT will do random projects to boost their portfolio). \n\n1. Backend Developer\/DevOps - Luckily, we already have someone for this role who can handle the server, databases, and other infrastructure.\n2. Frontend Developer - To build a responsive and accessible interface for web and mobile.\n3. UI\/UX Designer - To make the platform intuitive, inclusive, and welcoming for all users.\n4. QA Tester - To ensure everything functions well across devices and meets accessibility standards.\n\nBeyond tech skills, we\u2019d need people dedicated to keeping the platform financially sustainable and accessible. Ideally, we\u2019d have folks committed to organizing mutual aid and gathering ongoing resources to help with monthly maintenance, like server costs, and finding volunteers for outreach \/advertising the platform. \n\nPolitical ideologies are hollow if they don\u2019t translate into practical action, and I truly believe that if we had an easy way to connect, thousands of people would be eager to offer time, resources, or skills for their communities. Yes, grassroots organizing through local groups is vital, but let\u2019s be real, many community orgs struggle to meet the needs of all members, especially disabled and low-income folks. Many don\u2019t even provide basic accommodations, like masking, which excludes some people from even participating.\n\nSo, if you're a leftist IT professional or just someone with resources or passion for mutual aid, let\u2019s make this happen. Reach out to me, and let\u2019s talk about building a platform that can truly bring mutual aid into our communities in a sustainable, accessible way. \n\n(And yes I understand \"it is all not THAT easy\", but nothing about our lives is \"easy\". That should not be used as an argument to avoid helping eachother). \n\n",

My vision is for the project to be highly collaborative and I want to find folks to work on releases with virtually if possible. \n\nSome of the songs touch on topics related to \"late-stage capitalism\" a la the band Bodega, and I come at things from kind of a skeptical yet slightly silly, anarcho-pacifist type of perspective a la Crass. The first batch of songs is maybe not overtly political, but I have a release planned with some of the more political songs I've written.\n\nI would love to have a correspondence with someone I can bounce ideas off of or share tracks with. It would be cool if you also had Ableton and we could send Projects back and forth.

But if we assume that the State won\u2019t ever help us again, and that any and all projects to work with it are a waste of time, what will you do when any mutual aid project that seeks to offer an alternative to it is criminalized? When the police, army, or just bands of armed thugs with a presidential pardon in their back pocket break absolutely everything that anyone tries to build against them? People talk about building some mutual aid alternative to capitalism as if fascists won\u2019t seek to sterilize even the first sign of it. They got almost everything they wanted last night, they already had far more guns than anyone sympathetic to us, and to that arsenal they have now added the most powerful military force in human history. There is no low they will not stoop to, no blood they will not shed - nothing that we can hope to believe they won\u2019t try.\n\nI don\u2019t believe this is the end of the world, or that it\u2019s all doomed.

He found an American sponsor somehow (there was no internet back then and I doubt he even had telephone service in that small village in Greece.)\n\nOnce he was admitted, he joined the United States Army.  After his military service, he got married and had 4 children, including my mother (RIP).  Life was hard, but he worked hard and persevered.  He busted his butt in the copper mines.  He bought a home in Montana.  When his health deteriorated, he bought a home in Los Angeles and moved to L.A.  He was never on welfare.  He did not expect handouts.  He never broke the law and was never arrested.  Had he been refused entry, he would not have entered illegally, but rather, would have remained in Greece and lived the best life that he could.\n\nThat is how you do it, in my view.  You don't hop a fence, enter illegally, and demand special privileges.\n\nP.S. Someone asked me what AI I used to \"create\" the photo.  I had used the AI on a DNA\/Heritage website to add a bit of color to it.  But since the question was raised, I'll delete that photo and instead upload the unedited original photo, which is surprisingly sharp for that era.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1hstl4x44rje1.jpg?width=449&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c80ef4bb41dc6daea2805419179e08d1826d0e41",

We might experience a period similar to the \"Era of Good Feelings.\" Our system naturally favors two parties, so a new party will likely fill the spot of the DNC eventually. Republicans need to spend the meantime preparing for that world because sectionalism within the party is absolutely absurd and is already damaging the party's ability to get stuff done.

Therefore his impartiality can be challenged and he should recuse.\n\nhttps:\/\/x.com\/America1stLegal\/status\/1891226933481877590\n\nAs many of you may recall, judge McConnell issued a TRO broadly prohibiting the government from freezing spending(i believe it was originally from some OPM memo that they reversed before the TRO), then found the Trump admin wasn\u2019t obeying the order:\n\nhttps:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/funding-freeze-trump-federal-grants-loans-judge-ec9bf2700c41ec0ba4085d375599d295\n\nThis is the one where to comply, the govt would have to get preapproval for a broad range of cuts before doing them. Absurd. \n\nI for one think the TRO or a RO after it will all get tossed either by the judge or on appeal, but it seems he has a credible conflict as outlined by am first legal in the thread, so perhaps he will recuse himself shortly. \n\nPer am first legal: Federal law, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455, requires judges to disqualify themselves \u201cin any proceeding in which [their] impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d\n\nIt seems like it can reasonably be questioned at this point. \n\nMy understanding is that if a judge declines to recuse, that can be appealed and there\u2019s also a judge-run panel for alleged misconduct that can be leveraged. Congress could also impeach but that\u2019s very far down the road and probably would follow in a case where on appeal the finding was extra scathing. In this case I doubt he\u2019s ruling this way for his non profit but it doesn\u2019t look good so I think he should recuse.

        "selftext":"I\u2019m a research professor in STEM at a top American university. I would consider myself to lean conservative though I never had much interest in politics. I grew up in a very small rural town, but half my family are NY liberals, so I grew bored of the constant inane arguing between people who agree about nearly everything important. I\u2019m posting here because I\u2019m interested in what you all think about hard science. Not anything cultural, I\u2019m talking microbiology, physics, applied math, neuroscience, etc.\u00a0\n\nOver the long term, basic science conducted at universities and funded by various governments (mostly Germany, the UK, and more recently the US) has been by far the single largest driver of ever increasing prosperity. This is an indisputable fact, consider everything from antibiotics to nuclear power to computers. Basic science is also key to maintaining a powerful military. Private enterprise cannot and never has supported true basic science for two reasons.\u00a0\n\n* First, too much risk with too long of a time horizon. Investment in basic science is far more risky than even venture capital, and new ideas often take longer than a human life to generate profit. Thus it requires capital reserves and stability that only the strongest of governments possess.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Second, it is difficult to assign ownership. Important leaps forward that ultimately result in new families of technology are built on free discourse and public access to other scientist\u2019s research. This makes it impossible for a private enterprise to both be productive in research and maintain IP long term.\n\nHow do you address these problems in a conservative framework? Many of my colleagues are of the opinion that Trump \/ DOGE will be a disaster for science, but I\u2019m not sure. What do you think they\u2019re trying to achieve? I know many people who work at NIH \/ NSF \/ DOE (the agencies providing most of the research money), and they are confused by emails about DEI policy when that's never been something they think about. Many of us are worried that cuts and chaos in research will harm the country in the long term by destroying the lead we have in science and technology. I appreciate any thoughts.\n\n\\-Posting with a burner as I\u2019ve been asked not to talk publicly about politics for the time being.",

        "selftext":"This subreddit seems to be one of the few places on Reddit where I can voice a dissenting opinion without being banned, so I want to bring this topic into discussion. The Republican and conservative party has taken a hardline stance against remote work, opposing it even for roles that are perfectly suited for a work-from-home model.\n\nHaving worked from home for three years has been one of the best changes in my life. I work in tech, where the majority of my tasks are completed from a computer\u2014often by remotely accessing servers or helping colleagues who are also working from home. There is nothing I can't do just as well or even better at home versus in the office. Remote work has dramatically improved my work-life balance, allowed me to spend more time with my wife, and helped me find a healthy balance between my career and personal life.\n\nOf course, some jobs simply cannot be done remotely. But every time I see people rallying against remote work, it feels like their opposition comes from a place of resentment or misunderstanding. Many of these critics seem to have no idea what remote workers actually do. Their arguments often boil down to: *\u201cI had to suffer in an office, so everyone else should too.*\u201d\n\nI fail to see a single valid reason to deny someone the ability to work from home if their job can be performed remotely and they are doing it successfully. Sure, there will always be a few people who abuse remote work, but punishing the entire workforce for the actions of a few is shortsighted and counterproductive.\n\nThis anti-remote-work stance reminds me of other losing cultural battles conservatives have fought\u2014like opposition to [marijuana legalization ](https:\/\/news.gallup.com\/poll\/323582\/support-legal-marijuana-inches-new-high.aspx)or [gay marriage](https:\/\/news.gallup.com\/poll\/350486\/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx). Whether one agrees or disagrees with those issues morally, the reality is that the vast majority of Americans support them and the average American doesn't seem to[ oppose working from home](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/recode\/22576811\/remote-work-survey-data-for-progress-democrats-republicans-approval) either. Opposition to these issues will cost the conservative movement significant support among younger voters and white collar workers. \n\nThe conservative movement has actually done a fantastic job of regaining control over the cultural zeitgeist over the last four years\u2014a space the left dominated for what seems like forever. The reason I believe the left lost ground is because they fixated on issues that the average American simply doesn\u2019t care about. From pushing transgender ideology , forcing LGBT narratives onto the entire country or generally pandering to small minorities over the broader public, they alienated everyday people and drove voters into the conservative camp.\n\nHowever, if conservatives continue their blanket opposition to remote work, they risk falling into the same trap\u2014alienating voters over an issue that directly affects their quality of life. Younger generations deeply value work-life balance and flexibility. By positioning themselves as the party of \u201cbutts in seats\u201d rather than productivity and freedom, conservatives are not only driving away a key demographic but also jeopardizing their hard-won gains in the broader cultural conversation.\n\nIf conservatives want to maintain their momentum in the ongoing culture war, they need to pick their battles more wisely.

Which is a decent chunk but a lot of everything else is pretty small so far.   It will all add up in the end but if we started a thread dedicated to keeping track it would be really cool and allow us to discuss and share thoughts on the risk of cutting a program vs the value.\n\nRedundancies and programs that are bloated and running terrible will be the easy ones but USAID at least for me I'm a little mixed on because I'm not entirely sure how long term that will impact our foreign relations and strategic allies.  This is where great discussions on reform vs cut and how potential reform could realistically be implemented.\n\nI have seen some stuff where China is already jumping in to posture they will be the replacement for USAID which in turn could weaken our global presence and allies.   \n\nWould love to hear everyone else's thoughts on this.\n\nWe know we got to make the cuts and get back to a surplus.  I just would like to understand the process and how we are deciding it better.   \n\nElon is from the tech mindset when you have what we call in the industry technical debt sometimes the easiest way is to just turn it off, see what breaks and then turn it back on later if you have to.  That works sometimes with a company, you may lose some customers or valuable employees but in government we could be leaving ourselves open to global moves that weaken us long term but look like a win in the short term.\n\nIf there is already a thread on this please link.  This was just in my head this morning and with stuff moving so fast it would be great to see the facts of what is actually happening consolidated.",

Things that I once enjoyed are now overtaken by posts from sad and miserable Left leaning individuals.\n\nThis site no longer brings me any joy.\n\nIs there any other social media alternative where I can get my fix of what this website used to be about? I remember the days when people would actually post interesting things and I used to learn so much about life and its intricacies.\n\nI'm tired of the astroturfing and the brigading. I'm tired of the overwhelming collective of this website being opposed to innovation and change. I'm tired of being surrounded by people who want to blame others for their problems instead of championing their own life. I'm tired of presenting facts and being downvoted to oblivion to the point where I no longer have any incentive to contribute different ideas on this website.\n\nWe all have so little free time to ourselves outside of our obligations and I'm tired of spending it on this miserable platform. It's like the Left is trying desperately to bring me down to their level and have me as miserable and sad as they are. Misery loves company as they say.\n\nI miss the old Reddit so much. Where else is there to go?\n\nEdit: Someone falsely reported my post as self-harm or suicide and I got the Reddit cares message.\n\nEdit 2: Let me give you an example. This is from r\/gaming.

        "selftext":"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting in this subreddit, and I'm looking for some advice. I'm trying to navigate managing my Republican views in a very left-leaning company with liberal colleagues. I really enjoy my work, and my coworkers are great overall. I\u2019ve always been aware of their left-leaning perspectives.\n\nI\u2019ve been with this company for three years, and I haven\u2019t had many issues\u2014just a few debates over gun laws with two very liberal coworkers who have since left my work area. However, recent events, like an ICE raid in our city and the ongoing discussions surrounding Trump\u2019s downsizing, have led to more political talk at work. It's especially prominent because I work in research, and with the recent controversies around NIH funding and RFK Jr. being head of HHS these topics are now part of conversations.\n\nTo be upfront, I\u2019m not sure if I agree with cutting NIH funding, especially because my job is funded through grants that come from these sources, and the cancer research I do offers vital treatment options where there are currently very few. However, I do agree there is a lot of wasteful government spending, as highlighted by figures like Elon Musk and his DOGE team. But the prospect of cuts to NIH funding is concerning, even for me. I voted for Trump and trust his leadership, but I can\u2019t fully get behind everything that\u2019s being proposed in these areas and maybe it's because I don't fully understand what's happening. \n\nRegarding my coworkers, I feel outnumbered and a bit isolated because I don\u2019t share their views. For instance, during a coffee break today, the conversation turned to how disgusted everyone was with Trump\u2019s actions, and I found myself just sitting there quietly, scrolling on my phone. I\u2019m not an expert on politics or policies, so I don\u2019t feel confident enough to voice a different opinion, but I also don\u2019t want to feel like I have to sit alone during lab lunches or morning coffee hangouts. I know as time goes on, more of these conversations will come up, and I\u2019m not sure how to handle them without feeling like I have to withdraw from group events altogether.\n\nAny advice on how to manage these situations without feeling out of place would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n",

My dad trying to explain to me what he was talking about. Most of the time I just couldn't wait for the show to end so we could go back to music. \n\nAs I entered my 20s and became an adult I found Rush again, this time as I started taking my own road trips.   The older I became the more enjoyable his show became.  For better or for worse he was always there (with half is brain tied behind his back).  As I entered my 30s and had kids myself they also got to hear Rush while riding in the back seat, my wife and I trying to explain some of what he was talking about to them. I'm sure they felt the same way. \n\nNow that my own kids are entering their 20s I wish they could discover Rush for themselves as adults. His voice and even, level headed logic is sorely missed.  \n\nI'm sure many of you also have fond memories of hearing rush on the radio as a kid while you road in the back seat.",

        "title":"Republicans Are Wrong About Abortion",
        "selftext":"We won in 2024 by a small margin. With politicians starting to consider the 2026 midterms, we need to change how we look at abortion in order to convince more moderate and swing voters to pick Republican. We need to ensure a massive victory. **Abortion needs to be illegal** with the only exception being the life of the mother, but we can't win by calling people \"evil murderers\" if they object. They either simply don't care, or are offended by it. We can't compromise our values either, by saying \"allowed until (x) weeks\" or, \"with these exceptions.\" The culture around children and parenthood needs to change. Many European and Asian countries are heavily encouraging and promoting motherhood. They have programs and resources to help families start out, yet here in America, we push abortion. So, what do we need to change?\n\nThe reason so many people are pro-abortion is because there are many problems in our country that people sympathize with. These people genuinely think death is a better alternative than living in our current society. **They view abortion as the solution.** Republicans, on the other hand, view abortion as a problem that needs to be conquered, but then they don't look at why people actually support it. Instead, we should be looking at solutions that would make people happy to bring new life into this world. \n\nThe two most common excuses given for having an abortion are \"not being ready\" and \"not being able to afford it.\" These two reasons make up roughly half of abortions, and are somewhat similar. Women who aren't ready to raise a child don't have the knowledge, confidence, or finances to raise a child. The typical Republican response is \"make it illegal and figure out your own problems.\"  This response pushes people towards Democrats who do have a solution. It's a solution we all disagree with, but it's more than nothing. Republicans do have an ability to do something about it. We can influence the education system to incorporate extensive family planning into sex ex in schools, and offer more education resources for adults. Some Republicans are already willing to do this, they just don't incorporate it into the abortion argument. Republicans should be saying \"If you aren't ready to have a child, don't get an abortion, vote Republican to ease your struggles and love your child.\"\n\nParents who can't afford to raise their child are struggling because of our rough economy. The economy that is rough due to Democrat policy. Republicans have already established that we are the ones to make the economy boom. However, when it comes to abortion, women get told to \"figure it out on their own\" or \"pick yourself up by your bootstraps.\" Democrats have a solution, \"have an abortion.\" This is not the correct answer, but having an answer draws more people to their side than no answer. Republicans should be saying, \"Don't have an abortion, vote Republican to make the economy stronger, and you can afford your child.\"\n\nTeen pregnancy is another common excuse given for legalizing abortion. Again, with a Republican led curriculum, schools can offer support and education to teens who get pregnant. Encourage parents to help out, and educate them on proper parenting. These teens are seen as outcasts and villains, which shouldn't be the case. Life should be celebrated even if it's unplanned or too early. \n\nA woman can always give up her child for adoption, but the left complains that these systems lead to abuse and neglect. Some people doubt whether this claim is even accurate or not, because the adoption system is already heavily regulated and monitored. Either way, we just need Republicans willing to take over the system and solve any potential issues. Republicans could advertise, \"Don't have an abortion, vote Republican to make the adoption system safer.\"\n\nThere are plenty of other excuses given as well, but my point is the same for all of them. Republicans should look for ways in which they can solve these very real problems with our society, instead of telling people to fend for themselves. If we actually fix these problems, society as a whole would improve. This way, it would be easier to convince people that banning abortion outright is a good idea. We need to praise mothers, make them feel wanted, instead of the outcast. Even outside of the abortion argument, these are all things we should fix and encourage people to vote for. A lot of this is also at the state level, meaning this mid term election is important for more reasons than just the federal house and senate. We need to make the swing states fully red. ",

A businessman becoming president and working to make the government fiscally responsible is the kind of fiction you'd only find in books or films. I really didn't think Trump, in his 2nd term, now approaching 80 years old, was going to hit the ground flat out sprinting like this. It's absolutely miraculous that someone exceptional, like Elon Musk, just happened to exist at the same time and is motivated to help gut the rot from our bloated, corrupt government bureaucracy. \n\nIt's been over 20 years since the government operated without a deficit, and we now have hope we might experience that again before Trump's term ends. I still fear those who have too much to lose from a lean and efficient government will do something radical to stop this great work. Worse, they will likely attempt to field and fund a candidate in 2028 that allows them to refill the swamp.  I know many are overjoyed about our (actual conservatives) recent victory, but let's never forget the price of failure and how truly terrible the last four years have been. This is just the beginning; we have a lot of work to do to ensure America will be a sane, wealthy, and prosperous nation for our children and grandchildren.\n\nStay frosty folks!",

He got all the smart and weird tech people from Silicon Valley to come on board. \n\nFast forward to 2025. Trump rebrands it DOGE (United States DOGE Service). Keeps the acronym, keeps the funding, but gives it a whole new mission: Find the Receipts. \n\nLegally untouchable because it was already fully funded and operational. Trump invokes 5 USC 3161, which allows him to create temporary hiring authorities. DOGE teams get embedded inside every single federal agency. Each team consists of a lawyer, HR rep, a zoomer nerd, and an investigator. They report to DOGE, not the agency they're embedded in. \n\nTrump invokes 44 USC Chapter 35, which governs federal IT and cybersecurity oversight. Since USDS was originally an IT oversight body, DOGE now has full access to all federal data systems.\n\nCongress can't defund it because it's not a new program, just a repurposed one. DOJ can't sue for overreach because Trump used existing laws exactly as written. \nDOGE operates within existing frameworks. \n\nObama literally built the perfect Administrative IT backdoor. \n\nTrump and Musk just took the admin controls. The Administrative State can't stop it without rewriting multiple federal laws. \n\nNow, for the last 50-100 years, the legislature has been abdicating  more power to the executive branch, rather than doing its job. Dems controlled the House from 1954-1994, and the senate for abt half the time.  They built the current system. ",

I think during Covid, politics ramped up and suddenly everyone was required to have an opinion. I'm a registered dem and always thought that I leaned left. But after 2020, I couldn't ignore the obvious corruption of the democratic party. Covid policies put me over the edge. Then I entered a Masters program and it was literally filled with delusional, sensitive babies who actually stopped us from learning anything substantial because EVERYTHING was about race or gender. Idk. I guess it radicalized me.\n\n I started watching the other side's point of view and couldn't find much fault in their policies. Getting married and planning for a family also changes A LOT. Perspective has shifted to responsibility fulfillment, open-mindedness, and mostly accepting that I don't know everything. My husband and I find ourselves always siding with conservatives now.\n\nProblem is, my friends are all liberals around my age, and they are MELTING DOWN. I voted for Trump and had to keep it a secret. Every time I hang out with them there is a struggle session. We have to go over all the evils that Trump and Elon are doing. They're cutting off their families, they're in therapy twice a week. Some started taking antidepressants. Idk. I have tried being kind and listening. I'm at the end of my patience. \n\nHow can I find like-minded people that are my own age? They don't even NEED to be conservative. They just need to be respectful and capable of critical thinking. Should I join a local church? What kinds of groups attract these types of folks? ",

Like, really? Since when is having an opinion on a performance some kind of moral test? \n\nThis whole situation just screams Twitter activism at its finest\u2014shaming people for having personal taste while pretending to be some kind of moral authority. Meanwhile, xQc and Adin Ross are exposing the double standards and hypocrisy behind her take.\n\n  \n[Video on the whole subject (Click the text)](https:\/\/youtu.be\/WXi6cmg3B5g)\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is this another classic Pokimane virtue signal, or does she actually have a point?\n\n\n\n**For the older people in the sub that might not know who these people are a more detailed breakdown of the events and people involved:**                    \n\n**Pokimane** \u2013 A popular Twitch streamer and internet personality known for her gaming content and social commentary. She\u2019s been involved in various online controversies, often accused of being performative in her activism.\n\n**xQc** \u2013 A former professional Overwatch player turned massive Twitch streamer. He\u2019s known for his loud personality, unfiltered takes, and reaction content.\n\n**Adin Ross** \u2013 A streamer who gained popularity through gaming, interviews, and his connection to internet drama. He often gets involved in controversial discussions, especially in the Twitch and YouTube communities.\n\n# What Happened?\n\nDuring the **Super Bowl Halftime Show**, Kendrick Lamar performed, and while many people enjoyed it, others didn\u2019t. Some criticized the performance for various reasons\u2014maybe they didn\u2019t like the song choices, the stage setup, or just preferred another artist.\n\nPokimane, however, took issue with those criticisms, claiming that **people who disliked Kendrick\u2019s performance were being racist**. This rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, especially because **disliking a performance doesn\u2019t automatically mean someone is racist**\u2014sometimes, people just don\u2019t like the music.\n\nThis led to **xQc and Adin Ross pushing back**, calling her out for **virtue signaling**\u2014which basically means acting like she\u2019s morally superior to gain social approval, even if it\u2019s not genuine. They argued that **not every opinion has to be tied to race**, and shaming people for their personal taste is ridiculous.\n\n# Why It\u2019s a Big Deal\n\nThis situation highlights **the ongoing culture war on the internet**\u2014where any opinion can turn into a heated debate about race, morality, and political correctness. Some people feel like **Pokimane was reaching** just to score internet points, while others think she\u2019s calling out real bias.\n\n  \n",

Anywhere else, they revere the nature of the regime (the republic, the crown) or the political principle (democracy and freedom). But not the text of the constitution.\n\nAnyway. So i'm a French Conservative guy. Also happened to have a master degree in law here. I read the US Constitution following the conference by the White House spokeswoman explaining that judges censuring Trump EO were leftist militants weaponizing justice to limit the lawful executive power of the president.\n\nAnd.. how to say this. It is awfully dated and imprecise\n\nThe president really just is a referee of what the congress does. He's also commander in chief for the army and militia (militia ? WTF ?!).\n\nIt's never about an executive power the president has or executive orders can give. I guess layers and layers of court decisions had to make up for what's missing.\n\nI also heard about the two supreme court decisions. One that said that persecuting the president for official act was a trespassing from the judiciary branch to the executive. The other that said that regulation by agencies was a denial of the legislative branch.\n\nEverything that's missing and is needed is a legal and political battleground. So good luck with that.\n\nIf it wasn't such a gospel, you could just write it all down again with precised provisions of what the president and anyone can do, with the ways and forms technical regulations can be made.",

When the information came out, I was so confused about how my perception of reality was wrong.\n\nIn regards to DNC, I will never be a socialist, I disagree with it fully. However, Sanders was telling a message that things were rigged against the commoner. I respected him for standing up to traditional way of thinking. I remember seeing a picture of him when he was younger at a protest (i think Kent state but no it 100% sure) and respected that he stayed true to himself. Then the DNC colluded against him and instead of fighting for what he believed in he just rolled over. Now at the DNC he goes up after one billionaire complains about billionaires then another billionaire comes out to speak. He doesnt respect himself so i can longer respect him.\n\nWhat pivotal points over the past few years have made you vote red?",

Father died when I was 10, and my ma was an alcoholic who still managed to keep me and my sister fed. \n\nI\u2019ve worked in the trades since I was 14, and I am now 37. I graduated high in my class in high school but chose to continue in my feild instead. \n\nI moved to nyc in 2009, making something like 18\/hr in infrastructure repair. I was told repeatedly by my friends\/family\/colleagues that I should\u2019ve gone to college to get a better job that would pay better. \n\nNow I\u2019m a foreman and make around 150k-175k. Zero debts my whole life. Hardwork does in fact lead to success. You just need to have a half decent brain and a willingness to actually work hard to profit a company. Never on unemployment , never stopped working during Covid. \n\nPoliticians and the government as an entirety have never represented me and those around me. They have abandoned the thought of who keeps this country running. \n\nGov. Jobs definitely don\u2019t mean a damn to the general public, so why do dems give so much care to it? I get 3x pay to work in Canada and South America during crisis. America isn\u2019t paying my wages during this period.\n\nMy take is that we have an exorbitant amount of useless labor. They\u2019ve got nothing to offer but a bleeding heart and a desperate need to feel useful. \n\nDon\u2019t stop at DOGE, please also remove the DOB legislators, the failed architect turned project managers, and the state union contracts. All for unions as an entity but I\u2019ve run 60 man crews and have seen tax dollars be burned before my eyes. Literal nepotism families who can hang a single z-clip in 10 hours because the foreman isn\u2019t there to do layout. \n\nThey are all losing it, and I\u2019ve never felt better.

And my family are always democratic voters and even then I think I will always be liberal I don't see myself ever voting for a republican or conservative because I see no need to. I took a recently political test and found out I am more of a socialist democrat on the fact I care more about peoples rights then I do for anything else. Such as woman's rights to abortions etc. Yet I can never understand why conservatives feel the need to get into peoples business. When Biden  was president he passed the marriage equality act which the republicans barley agreed to which allowed same sex couples to marry. And yet somehow conservatives thought by passing this it was going to affect their right to marry when all it did was make it to where same sex couples could marry like straight ones. And then here I am thinking as a pan-sexual trans woman why do they care so much about who marries who I don't care who someone else's marries because I think its none of my business to care. I notice liberals work more with conservatives then conservatives work with liberals when conservatives introduce something they typically try to negation with them and or find a better replacement conservatives just want to stall and not offer any replacement whatsoever. As far as same sex couples go as well they always say marriage is meant to be by god or for some religious reason when legal marriage is just the state and county singing a piece of paper it has nothing to do with religion. And then I think if they want to get married in a religious way then get married in a church. And don't get me wrong I grew up in a catholic family and am still catholic but I think its dumb some of these conservatives use religion as a way of life they always assume the first amendment says freedom for religion but it can also be freedom against religion which means it says you have the right to be atheist.

They prefer leftist, which leads them to follow creators who spend more time attacking democrats than republicans. \n\nI understand and share your critiques of the party, but every time you comment something like \u201cthe democrats have no balls\u201d or \u201cfeels like we have no opposition party\u201d it enforces apathy and suppresses turnout. YOU might still vote despite your frustration, but 50 people who read your comment may not. Plus it\u2019s not exactly true. There are democrats everywhere fighting, I am proud of my senators in Oregon who fight daily. They don\u2019t have TikTok, so are not seen like AOC. \n\nOkay final thoughts.\n\nThroughout history, small organized groups have changed the course of history, against overwhelming odds. Feels like people long to be part of something, a purpose, a resistance. Well the time is now. Let\u2019s fight dirty, how can we take back our online spaces?\n\n",

(Illegally cutting off federal funding, illegally shutting down federal agencies, illegally firing various federal employees, illegally granting access to sensitive government data and software, illegally offering resignation buyouts to federal employees, etc.)\n\nWho can stop the coup and how? A brief guide\\*:\n\n**Step 1: Courts**\n\nMany lawsuits have been filed and continue to be filed against the executive branch. Judges have already begun issuing injunctions and rulings against the executive branch. If the executive branch abides by the injunctions and rulings (or abides while appealing the cases and ultimately abides by the final ruling) the coup stops here. \ud83d\uded1 If not, proceed to step 2. \u27a1\ufe0f\n\n**Note:** If a case reaches the Supreme Court and the partisan justices issue a blatantly unconstitutional ruling, skip ahead to step 3. \u27a1\ufe0f\n\n**Step 2: DOJ**\n\nA judge can rule that the defendant is in contempt of court. Then the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch, orders the U.S. Marshals to arrest them and bring them to court. If the DOJ does its job, the coup stops here. \ud83d\uded1 If not, proceed to step 3. \u27a1\ufe0f\n\n**Step 3: Congress**\n\nCongress has the power to impeach and convict the President, Vice President, Supreme Court justices, and any civil officers of the United States. Upon conviction, the person found guilty is removed from office. If Congress does its job, the coup stops here. \ud83d\uded1 If not, proceed to step 4. \u27a1\ufe0f\n\n**Step 4: The People**\n\nNonviolent protests that engage at least 3.5% of the population have [historically never failed](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/future\/article\/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world). In the U.S. this threshold is around 12 million people. (75 million people voted for Kamala Harris, so this threshold amounts to 16% of Harris voters.) The coup stops here. \ud83d\uded1\n\n**Actions you can take during the steps above:**\n\n* Call your U.S. Senators and Congress Rep every day. ([5 Calls app ](https:\/\/5calls.org\/)makes this easy.) Put pressure on them to stop the coup. Tell them to use their media influence to inform the public about the coup.\n* Spread the word. Make sure your friends and family know about the coup.\n* If you\u2019re a journalist: Remind your editors that we\u2019re in the middle of a coup. It deserves as much (if not more) coverage than a plane crash.\n* If you\u2019re a federal employee: Hold the line, don\u2019t resign.\n* If you\u2019re active military: Remember that you\u2019re legally required to disobey unlawful orders.\n\n**Additional recommendations:**\n\n* Join the [Indivisible](https:\/\/indivisible.org\/) email list for updates and coordinated action plans.\n* There are 2 House seats up for grabs in a special election in Florida on April 1. Consider volunteering or donating to Democratic candidates [Josh Weil](https:\/\/www.joshweil.us\/) and [Gay Valimont](https:\/\/gayforcongress.com\/).\n\n\\*If I missed something or you have something to add, please comment, and I will update this guide.",

        "selftext":"Lori Gallagher nailed this. \n\n*****\n\"I'm a liberal, but that doesn't mean what a lot of you apparently think it does. Let's break it down, shall we? Because quite frankly, I'm getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for. Spoiler alert: not every liberal is the same, though the majority of liberals I know think along roughly these same lines:\n\n1. I believe a country should take care of its weakest members. A country cannot call itself civilized when its children, disabled, sick, and elderly are neglected. PERIOD.\n\n2. I believe healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Somehow that's interpreted as \"I believe Obamacare is the end-all, be-all.\" This is not the case. I'm fully aware that the ACA has problems, that a national healthcare system would require everyone to chip in, and that it's impossible to create one that is devoid of flaws, but I have yet to hear an argument against it that makes \"let people die because they can't afford healthcare\" a better alternative. I believe healthcare should be far cheaper than it is, and that everyone should have access to it. And no, I'm not opposed to paying higher taxes in the name of making that happen.\n\n3. I believe education should be affordable. It doesn't necessarily have to be free (though it works in other countries so I'm mystified as to why it can't work in the US), but at the end of the day, there is no excuse for students graduating college saddled with five- or six-figure debt.\n\n4. I don't believe your money should be taken from you and given to people who don't want to work. I have literally never encountered anyone who believes this. Ever. I just have a massive moral problem with a society where a handful of people can possess the majority of the wealth while there are people literally starving to death, freezing to death, or dying because they can't afford to go to the doctor. Fair wages, lower housing costs, universal healthcare, affordable education, and the wealthy actually paying their share would go a long way toward alleviating this. Somehow believing that makes me a communist.\n\n5. I don't throw around \"I'm willing to pay higher taxes\" lightly. If I'm suggesting something that involves paying more, well, it's because I'm fine with paying my share as long as it's actually going to something besides lining corporate pockets or bombing other countries while Americans die without healthcare.\n\n6. I believe companies should be required to pay their employees a decent, livable wage. Somehow this is always interpreted as me wanting burger flippers to be able to afford a penthouse apartment and a Mercedes. What it actually means is that no one should have to work three full-time jobs just to keep their head above water. Restaurant servers should not have to rely on tips, multibillion-dollar companies should not have employees on food stamps, workers shouldn't have to work themselves into the ground just to barely make ends meet, and minimum wage should be enough for someone to work 40 hours and live.\n\n7. I am not anti-Christian. I have no desire to stop Christians from being Christians, to close churches, to ban the Bible, to forbid prayer in school, etc. (BTW, prayer in school is NOT illegal; *compulsory* prayer in school is - and should be - illegal). All I ask is that Christians recognize *my* right to live according to *my* beliefs. When I get pissed off that a politician is trying to legislate Scripture into law, I'm not \"offended by Christianity\" -- I'm offended that you're trying to force me to live by your religion's rules. You know how you get really upset at the thought of Muslims imposing Sharia law on you? That's how I feel about Christians trying to impose biblical law on me. Be a Christian. Do your thing. Just don't force it on me or mine.\n\n8. I don't believe LGBT people should have more rights than you. I just believe they should have the *same* rights as you.\n\n9. I don't believe illegal immigrants should come to America and have the world at their feet, especially since THIS ISN'T WHAT THEY DO (spoiler: undocumented immigrants are ineligible for all those programs they're supposed to be abusing, and if they're \"stealing\" your job it's because your employer is hiring illegally). I believe there are far more humane ways to handle undocumented immigration than our current practices (i.e., detaining children, splitting up families, ending DACA, etc).\n\n10. I don't believe the government should regulate everything, but since greed is such a driving force in our country, we NEED regulations to prevent cut corners, environmental destruction, tainted food\/water, unsafe materials in consumable goods or medical equipment, etc. It's not that I want the government's hands in everything -- I just don't trust people trying to make money to ensure that their products\/practices\/etc. are actually SAFE. Is the government devoid of shadiness? Of course not. But with those regulations in place, consumers have recourse if they're harmed and companies are liable for medical bills, environmental cleanup, etc. Just kind of seems like common sense when the alternative to government regulation is letting companies bring their bottom line into the equation.\n\n11. I believe our current administration is fascist. Not because I dislike them or because I can\u2019t get over an election, but because I've spent too many years reading and learning about the Third Reich to miss the similarities. Not because any administration I dislike must be Nazis, but because things are actually mirroring authoritarian and fascist regimes of the past.\n\n12. I believe the systemic racism and misogyny in our society is much worse than many people think, and desperately needs to be addressed. Which means those with privilege -- white, straight, male, economic, etc. -- need to start listening, even if you don't like what you're hearing, so we can start dismantling everything that's causing people to be marginalized.\n\n13. I am not interested in coming after your blessed guns, nor is anyone serving in government. What I am interested in is the enforcement of present laws and enacting new, common sense gun regulations. Got another opinion? Put it on your page, not mine.\n\n14. I believe in so-called political correctness. I prefer to think it\u2019s social politeness. If I call you Chuck and you say you prefer to be called Charles I\u2019ll call you Charles. It\u2019s the polite thing to do. Not because everyone is a delicate snowflake, but because as Maya Angelou put it, when we know better, we do better. When someone tells you that a term or phrase is more accurate\/less hurtful than the one you're using, you now know better. So why not do better? How does it hurt you to NOT hurt another person?\n\n15. I believe in funding sustainable energy, including offering education to people currently working in coal or oil so they can change jobs. There are too many sustainable options available for us to continue with coal and oil. Sorry, billionaires. Maybe try investing in something else.\n\n16. I believe that women should not be treated as a separate class of human. They should be paid the same as men who do the same work, should have the same rights as men and should be free from abuse. Why on earth shouldn\u2019t they be?\n\nI think that about covers it. Bottom line is that I'm a liberal because I think we should take care of each other. That doesn't mean you should work 80 hours a week so your lazy neighbor can get all your money. It just means I don't believe there is any scenario in which preventable suffering is an acceptable outcome as long as money is saved.\"\n\n~ Lori Gallagher\n\nI have edited this to site who it should be credited to.

        "selftext":"The transformation of Afghanistan in the 1970s into a conservative religious state and recent cultural shifts in the United States share some parallels in terms of societal responses to modernization, polarization, and the role of religion.\n\nSimilarities:\n\n1. Backlash Against Modernization:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0- In Afghanistan, rapid modernization efforts in the 20th century\u2014such as women's education and secular reforms\u2014provoked strong resistance from conservative rural populations, leading to a reversal toward religious conservatism.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0- In the U.S., cultural debates over progressive policies (e.g., gender rights, education reforms) have fueled polarization, with some groups advocating for a return to traditional or religious values.\n\n\n2. Urban-Rural Divide:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Afghanistan experienced a widening gap between urban elites embracing modernization and rural communities adhering to traditional Islamic norms[2].\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Similarly, the U.S. has seen divisions between urban areas leaning progressive and rural regions favoring conservative ideologies.\n\n\n3. Rise of Religious Conservatism:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0- In Afghanistan, political instability and external interventions enabled the rise of Islamist movements like the Taliban, which imposed strict religious laws.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0- In the U.S., there has been a resurgence of Christian nationalist rhetoric among certain political factions, emphasizing religion's role in governance.\n\n\n4. Polarization and Reactionary Movements:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0- In both contexts, societal polarization has led to reactionary movements opposing perceived threats to cultural or religious identity, whether through Islamization in Afghanistan or conservative pushes in the U.S.\n\n\nWhile the specifics differ\u2014Afghanistan's changes were shaped by war and foreign intervention\u2014the underlying dynamics of resistance to rapid change and cultural divides are comparable.",

        "selftext":"If you are in a district that is represented by one of these Representatives, call and ask them why they are letting Elon Musk, an unelected private citizen, ***hurt American Farmers*** by Shutting Down USAID. Look below and remind them of their own words.   \n  \nEven if your Representative is not listed, ask them why they are letting Elon Musk hurt American Famers by shutting down the USAID which funding is under the authority of Congress.\n\nOne of the most important statements from the Summary.\n\n&gt;**Several members expressed concern about the Administration's budget requests** to reduce or eliminate funding for programs that utilize U.S. agricultural commodities, ***fearing it would negatively impact American farmers***.\n\n[https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/event\/116th-congress\/house-event\/110307\/text](https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/event\/116th-congress\/house-event\/110307\/text)\n\nThis document is a transcript of a House Committee Hearing titled **\"The Implementation of Farm Bill International Food Assistance and Development Programs\"**. The hearing took place on December 10, 2019, before the Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture of the House Committee on Agriculture.\n\nThe hearing focused on the implementation of the international food assistance and development programs authorized by the 2018 Farm Bill. Key topics and themes discussed during the hearing include:\n\n* **The importance of international food assistance programs** in addressing humanitarian needs, enhancing national security, and promoting global stability and cooperation.\n* **The role of various programs** such as McGovern-Dole Food for Education, Food for Progress, and Food for Peace. These programs aim to provide food assistance, improve agricultural practices, and build capacity in developing countries.\n* **The collaboration between the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)** in implementing these programs. Both agencies work with various partners, including non-governmental organizations and international organizations.\n* ***The emphasis on using U.S. agricultural commodities*** in food aid programs. Members of the subcommittee expressed concern that there may be a bias towards cash and vouchers, and wanted to ensure American farmers and their products are a key part of the programs.\n* **The importance of program oversight and accountability** to ensure that aid reaches the intended beneficiaries and is not misused. Monitoring methods include third-party monitoring, biometric registration, and feedback hotlines.\n* **The budget requests from the Administration** to consolidate international food assistance programs into a single account which would reduce funding for some programs. This proposed consolidation raised concerns among committee members who believe it would diminish the role of the USDA and potentially reduce the amount of U.S. commodities used in the food programs.\n* **The role of these programs in national security**, by increasing global stability, and cooperation. The programs also aim to promote international partnerships and mutually beneficial trading relationships.\n\nThe hearing included testimonies from Ken Isley, Administrator of the Foreign Agricultural Service at USDA, and Trey Hicks, Director of the Office of Food for Peace at USAID. Members of the Subcommittee asked questions and expressed their views on the implementation of these programs.\n\nSeveral representatives expressed comments and concerns regarding farmers, American farmers, and farm families during the House Committee Hearing on \"The Implementation of Farm Bill International Food Assistance and Development Programs.\" These comments emphasize the importance of supporting American agriculture through international food assistance programs.\n\nHere are some of the key points made by the representatives:\n\n* **Jim Costa (Democrat), Chairman of the Subcommittee,** stated that American farmers, ranchers, dairymen, and women are the ones who produce the food for these programs and \"nobody does it better than the American farmer\". He emphasized that providing support improves livelihoods and builds partnerships throughout the breadbasket of America.\n* ***David Rouzer (Republican)*****, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee,** highlighted the role of American farmers in producing the crops delivered through in-kind food aid. He stated that \"a bag of rice, wheat, flour, or any one of dozens of other products grown by U.S. farmers are powerful symbols of the productivity and generosity of America\". He also noted that food assistance and international agriculture development rely on partnerships with \"fine farm families\" and food processors in the United States. He stressed that U.S. farm products are \"the true backbone of the assistance the United States provides\" and that \"American agriculture in-kind assistance remains as the backbone for years to come\".\n* ***K. Michael Conaway (Republican)*****, a Representative in Congress from Texas,** stated that there is a \"strong partnership between USDA and USAID\" and a \"broad coalition of stakeholders both in the United States and internationally\". He expressed concern that there may be a bias in favor of cash and vouchers over in-kind food purchases and wanted to ensure that American farmers participate in these programs. He also noted that the American people support these programs in large part because they believe it is American-grown products that are being used.\n* **Collin C. Peterson (Democrat), a Representative in Congress from Minnesota,** noted that dry peas and lentils, which are a staple in international food assistance programs, had dropped significantly in price. He pointed out that this drop in price should have resulted in more purchases of these commodities, benefiting American farmers who produce them.\n* ***Roger W. Marshall (Republican)*****, a Representative in Congress from Kansas**, mentioned the history of the Food for Peace program, which was started by a Kansas farmer and later signed into legislation by President Eisenhower, also from Kansas. He also emphasized that it is important to him that the programs use agriculture products made in the U.S.\n* **Jim Hagedorn (passed away, but his words are important), a Representative in Congress from Minnesota,** stated that these programs \"demonstrate the wonderful system of agriculture that we have, the expertise and the technology and in ag land with our farmers' hard work and the work that is done by our agribusinesses puts us in a position not just to trade with other countries and help provide food, but to literally give it away in many instances here to help people all around the world.\" He added, \"We are very much interested in you taking products from our farmers and sending them to other countries, and not necessarily distribute cash payments. We think that that is very important\".\n* **Don Bacon (Republican), a Representative in Congress from Nebraska,** stated that \"Nebraska is proud of being like the lead exporter for beef, and go up and down the line and agriculture is one of our nation's strengths and it is a source of our nation's power and prosperity. And I just tell you, our farmers and our agriculture sector in Nebraska are proud to help feed the world, and we prefer not handing a check. We like providing our surplus, which we have\". He also noted that American farmers are a \"force for good\".\n\nIn summary, the ***representatives from both sides of the aisle showed a strong interest in ensuring that American farmers and farm families benefit*** from international food assistance programs by selling their products and also through having the programs enhance the image of American agriculture globally. They expressed concerns about potential shifts away from in-kind aid and towards cash assistance, which they see as a threat to American agricultural producers.\n\nPlease feel free to share this or repost this where others can see it.",

        "selftext":"Here\u2019s some advice from a high-level staffer for a Senator. Re-posting from a friend of mine:  \nThere are two things that we should be doing all the time right now, and they\u2019re by far the most important things.  \nYou should NOT be bothering with online petitions or emailing.  \n  \n1) The best thing you can do to be heard and get your congressperson to pay attention is to have face-to-face time \u2014 if they have town halls, go to them. Go to their local offices. If you\u2019re in DC, try to find a way to go to an event of theirs. Go to the \u201cmobile offices\u201d that their staff hold periodically (all these times are located on each congressperson\u2019s website). When you go, ask questions. A lot of them. And push for answers. The louder and more vocal and present you can be at those the better.  \n  \n2) But those in-person events don\u2019t happen every day. So, the absolute most important thing that people should be doing every day is calling.  \n  \nYOU SHOULD MAKE 6 CALLS A DAY:  \n2 each (DC office and your local office) to your 2 Senators &amp; your 1 Representative.  \n  \nThe staffer was very clear that any sort of online contact basically gets immediately ignored, and letters pretty much get thrown in the trash (unless you have a particularly strong emotional story \u2014 but even then it\u2019s not worth the time it took you to craft that letter).  \n  \nCalls are what all the congresspeople pay attention to. Every single day, the Senior Staff and the Senator get a report of the 3 most-called-about topics for that day at each of their offices (in DC and local offices), and exactly how many people said what about each of those topics. They\u2019re also sorted by zip code and area code. She said that Republican callers generally outnumber Democrat callers 4-1, and when it\u2019s a particular issue that single-issue-voters pay attention to (like gun control, or planned parenthood funding, etc...), it\u2019s often closer to 11-1, and that\u2019s recently pushed Republican congressmen on the fence to vote with the Republicans. In the last 8 years, Republicans have called, and Democrats haven\u2019t.  \n  \nSo, when you call:  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A) When calling the DC office, ask for the Staff member in charge of whatever you\u2019re calling about (\u201cHi, I\u2019d like to speak with the staffer in charge of Healthcare, please\u201d) \u2014 local offices won\u2019t always have specific ones, but they might. If you get transferred to that person, awesome. If you don\u2019t, that\u2019s ok \u2014 ask for that person\u2019s name, and then just keep talking to whoever answered the phone. Don\u2019t leave a message (unless the office doesn\u2019t pick up at all \u2014 then you can \u2014 but it\u2019s better to talk to the staffer who first answered than leave a message for the specific staffer in charge of your topic).  \n\u00a0\u00a0 \nGive them your zip code. They won\u2019t always ask for it, but make sure you give it to them, so they can mark it down. Extra points if you live in a zip code that traditionally votes for them, since they\u2019ll want to make sure they get\/keep your vote.  \n  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0C) If you can make it personal, make it personal. \u201cI voted for you in the last election and I\u2019m worried\/happy\/whatever\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a teacher, and I am appalled by Betsy DeVos,\u201d or \u201cas a single mother\u201d or \u201cas a white, middle class woman,\u201d or whatever.  \n  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0D) Pick 1-2 specific things per day to focus on. Don\u2019t rattle off everything you\u2019re concerned about \u2014 they\u2019re figuring out what 1-2 topics to mark you down for on their lists. So, focus on 1-2 per day. Ideally something that will be voted on\/taken up in the next few days, but it doesn\u2019t really matter \u2014 even if there\u2019s not a vote coming up in the next week, call anyway. It\u2019s important that they just keep getting calls.  \n  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0E) Be clear on what you want \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that the Senator...\u201d or \u201cI want to thank the Senator for their vote on... \u201c or \u201cI want the Senator to know that voting in _____ way is the wrong decision for our state because... \u201c Don\u2019t leave any ambiguity.  \n  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0F) They may get to know your voice\/get sick of you \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. The people answering the phones generally turn over every 6 weeks anyway, so even if they\u2019re really sick of you, they\u2019ll be gone in 6 weeks.  \n  \nFrom experience since the election: If you hate being on the phone &amp; feel awkward (which is a lot of people) don\u2019t worry about it \u2014 there are a bunch of scripts (Indivisible has some, there are lots of others floating around these day). After a few days of calling, it starts to feel a lot more natural.  \n  \nPut the 6 numbers in your phone (all under P \u2013 Politician.) An example is McCaskill MO, Politician McCaskill DC, Politician Blunt MO, etc., which makes it really easy to click down the list each day.",

        "selftext":"Please, I urge you to write to your senators and demand they pass preemptive protections against those who are being rounded up by ICE and sent who knows where. There is a far more nefarious plan at play here and we need to be on the offense. I have drafted a letter that I sent urging legislation to be past protecting migrants re: Lake Riley Act and the news that Trump is Withdrawing United States From UN Human Rights Council.  \n  \nWhat was in the Laken Riley Act? WASHINGTON - President Trump signed his first piece of legislation into law, the Laken Riley Act. This law mandates the federal detention of illegal immigrants who are accused of theft, burglary, assaulting a law enforcement officer, and any crime that causes death or serious bodily injury.\n\nHere is a template you can use to send to your Senators if you feel so inclined! \n\n**\\[Your Name\\]**  \n\\[Your Address\\]  \n\\[City, State, ZIP Code\\]  \n\\[Your Email\\]  \n\\[Your Phone Number\\]  \n\\[Date\\]\n\n**\\[Recipient's Name\\]**  \n\\[Recipient\u2019s Title\\]  \n\\[Office Address\\]  \n\\[City, State, ZIP Code\\]\n\n**Subject:** Urgent Action Needed to Prevent the Exploitation of Incarcerated Individuals in Medical Research &amp; Protect Human Rights\n\nDear \\[Senators Name\\],\n\nI am writing to express my deep concern regarding the potential exploitation of incarcerated individuals in experimental medical research, particularly as Neuralink, a company owned by Elon Musk, begins human trials for its controversial brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. Given Musk\u2019s erratic behavior and Neuralink\u2019s history of unethical animal testing, there is a real and urgent risk that prisoners\u2014who are among the most vulnerable populations in the U.S.\u2014could be coerced or incentivized into dangerous experiments with inadequate oversight and informed consent.\n\nWhile existing regulations under the Common Rule (45 CFR 46 Subpart C) provide some restrictions on medical research involving prisoners, loopholes remain that allow private companies to:\n\n* **Target incarcerated individuals** as test subjects, leveraging their lack of autonomy and limited access to legal representation.\n* **Use financial incentives or promises of better treatment** to pressure participation, making true informed consent questionable.\n* **Claim that participation is \"voluntary\"** when, in reality, the prison environment inherently creates coercive conditions.\n\nGiven Neuralink\u2019s troubling track record\u2014including reports of animal suffering, rushed testing procedures, and serious safety concerns raised by the FDA\u2014it is imperative that Congress acts now to prevent the exploitation of prisoners in experimental research that does not serve their direct medical interests.\n\n# Additional Concern: Expansion of Guant\u00e1namo Bay Detention Facility\n\nFurthermore, I am alarmed by recent reports that the administration plans to expand the detention facilities at Guant\u00e1namo Bay to house up to 30,000 deported migrants as part of the Laken Riley Act and accompanying executive actions. This expansion raises significant human rights concerns, particularly regarding the potential for detainees to be subjected to experimental medical procedures without proper consent. The combination of an increased detained population and the initiation of human trials by companies like Neuralink heightens the risk of unethical practices.\n\n# Escalating Threat: U.S. Withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council\n\nIn addition to these alarming developments, President Trump has announced the withdrawal of the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and the cessation of funding for the UN agency aiding Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. [apnews.com](https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/05e1d57bbb41df38771d1ab69adb21a3?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nThe UNHRC serves as a critical global watchdog against human rights violations, including unethical medical experimentation, coercion, and abuse of vulnerable populations. This withdrawal diminishes international oversight and increases the risk of human rights abuses going unchecked.\n\nThe U.S. has a documented history of medical experimentation on prisoners\u2014from the Tuskegee syphilis experiments to radiation testing on inmates. We must not allow billionaires and private corporations to revive these unethical practices under the guise of \u201cinnovation,\u201d especially at a time when the U.S. is distancing itself from international human rights protections.\n\n# Proposed Legislative Protections\n\nI urge you to introduce or support new legislation that would:\n\n* **Explicitly prohibit high-risk medical experiments on incarcerated individuals**, unless the research directly benefits their own health and well-being.\n* **Close loopholes** that allow private corporations to conduct research on prisoners under the guise of \u201cvoluntary\u201d participation.\n* **Mandate strict third-party oversight and legal representation** for any study involving incarcerated individuals.\n* **Implement severe penalties** for companies found to be coercing or targeting prisoners for experimental trials.\n* **Ban private companies from lobbying** to weaken prisoner protections in medical research.\n* **Ensure the U.S. remains accountable to international human rights standards**, despite its withdrawal from the UNHRC.\n\nThis is not just a medical ethics issue\u2014it is a human rights issue. I urge you to take immediate action to protect vulnerable individuals from corporate exploitation and prevent Neuralink\u2014or any other private entity\u2014from using prisoners as test subjects for unproven, high-risk medical procedures.\n\nThank you for your time, leadership, and commitment to justice. I look forward to your response.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\\[Your Name\\]\n\n\n\n   ",

If Potas is going to skew the data because of wishful thinking, Potas would probably do so in such a way as to make the situation seem much better for the anti-abortion people or much worse for pro-choice people than is the case here in reality. It seems pretty unlikely that someone, who wants to end abortion, would skew the data to make it seem better for supporters of abortion rights or worse for opponents of abortion rights than is the case here in reality.  \n\nAs a pro-choice person, I feel that this is good news. However, it makes me wonder what percent of the people in the anti-abortion crowd have really thought through the issue. \n\nThe pro-life position literally says; A fetus is a person, the fetus\u2019 right to live takes precedent over a woman\u2019s right to control what happens to her body and this issue is so important that the government has a duty to intervene and force a woman to remain pregnant. \n\nIf I believed that, I would not be willing to compromise on the issue. \n",

        "selftext":"Thanks to their private texts and public pronouncements, we know that Trump and his lackeys have salivated for years over the prospect of \"Marshall Law.\" We also know from Trump's inaction on J6, his ritual celebration of that day's violence, his vilification of the cops who defended the Capitol, and his pardons of cop-bludgeoning brownshirts that he is pro-coup. And we know from his campaign promises that he's chomping at the bit to sic the U.S. military on U.S. citizens. He just needs a pretext, and once again, his Proud Boys are \"standing by\" to provide it. The only thing stopping them is federal law enforcement, and Trump can remove this obstacle by purging agents with integrity who do their jobs. \n\n\"The day after the fire, at Hitler's request, President Hindenburg signed the Reichstag Fire Decree into law,\" according to Wikipedia. The decree \"suspended most civil liberties in Germany, including habeas corpus, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, the right of free association and public assembly, and the secrecy of the post and telephone.\" Which squares pretty well with Trump's wish list for America. \n\nThe Reichstag Fire Decree, Wikipedia continues, \"was used by the Nazis to ban publications not considered friendly.\" Trump has, of course, proposed doing just that to unfriendly \"fake news\" outlets. \n\n\"Hitler, after having obtained his emergency powers, announced that it was the start of a wider communist effort to take over Germany,\" per Wikipedia. Sounds like the Deep State\u2122 conspiracies of Trump's paranoid fantasies. \n\nHe already has his emergency powers. All he needs now is his emergency. ",

Victor Orban destroyed democracy in Hungary. That might make you think that Trump will do the same to America. However, the system is much more complex and rigid in The US. It is unbelievably difficult to amend the constitution, I doubt that such a process would happen in the course of the next four years. To see why and how I can be so sure of that, research how an amendment can be added to the US constitution. While Trump can, and will, attempt to weaken democracy, it is hard to say how successful such an attempt will be. Furthermore, He cannot cancel the 2028 election ( https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/538\/trump-cancel-2028-election-weaken-democracy\/story?id=117807079 ).

        "selftext":"Discussion:\n\nDuring his tenure, Trump has aggressively pursued policies that hurt his opponents while primarily benefiting wealthy elites and corporations and leaving his rural, low-income, and working-class supporters behind. His tax cuts overwhelmingly favored the rich and large businesses, while providing little long-term relief for middle and low income Americans. His administration\u2019s rollback of environmental protections benefited fossil fuel companies but led to increased pollution in rural and industrial areas, disproportionately harming working-class communities and POC. While he claimed to fight for American jobs, his trade wars hurt farmers and small businesses, many of whom supported him but suffered from lost markets and increased costs. His attacks on the Affordable Care Act and cuts to social programs disproportionately affected low-income voters, including many in the MAGA movement, who rely on Medicaid, food assistance, and disability benefits. Meanwhile, his deregulation of industries, opposition to minimum wage increases, and support for corporate interests have made it harder for working class Americans to earn a living wage. Overall, Trump\u2019s policies have strengthened the wealth and power of corporations and the ultra-rich while leaving many of his most loyal supporters struggling with stagnant wages, rising healthcare costs, and worsening economic inequality. So,this leaves me to understand that Trump\u2019s overarching plan is not to strengthen the Republican Party or even Christian ideology, it is to make life extremely difficult for Democrats, those that oppose far-right policies, and anyone else who challenges him. Some people just like to see the world burn. \n\nDo you know of any Trump voters that have been negatively affected by this policies?

        "selftext":"In 2020, the supreme court ruled that employment discrimination against gay people is unconstitutional. The reason behind this decision was as follows. If a man, who is in a relationship with another man, is subject to employment discrimination because he is in a relationship with a man, but a woman can be in a relationship with a man without facing any such discrimination, that is gender discrimination. Republican justices John Roberts and Neil Gorsuch (who were appointed by George W Bush and Donald Trump respectively) voted with the majority. Two Republican justices voted in favor of gay rights. \n\nOpen a US history textbook and you may notice a trend that has occurred over the past 150 years. There is a group of people (women, gay people, racial minorities, etc.) who do not enjoy the same rights and protections under the law as others. There is controversy there. The issue really is as simple as; one side of the debate says that this group should enjoy the same rights and opportunities as everyone else, the other side believes that that group of people should be treated as second class citizens. The latter group\u2019s entire argument is it is good when X group does it but yucky when Y group does it. The controversy really is as simple as that. When this happens, usually; A few people to the left of the political spectrum speak up and advocate for this positive change, but it seems unlikely that this change will ever occur. Year after year, more and more people on the political left not only advocate for it but attend marches and hold protests. Eventually, pretty much everyone on the left supports giving equal rights to this marginalized group, and the right is deeply divided on whether or not these people should enjoy equal rights. Decades later, we have reached a point where the vast majority of people (barring a very small minority of people) agree that the right in question should be granted to all people. It is amazing to most of us that this was ever controversial. \n\nHere are a few examples of what I mean. \n\nWhen the constitution was first ratified, women could not vote. Around the late 19th and early 20th century, a small minority of people began to entertain the thought that maybe women should vote. Most people (even women themselves) believed otherwise. Some people worried that women were too emotional to vote. To that I say; who is to say that being emotional automatically means that any vote you cast will be misguided. Some people felt that every woman would just vote the same as her husband. Not only is there a fairly decent chance that at least some women (maybe even a lot of women) would not vote the same way as their husbands, this argument fails to consider that unmarried people might vote. The social custom where women and children were to be the first ones rescued in a disaster was created to fuel the idea that women do not need to vote, because men will always prioritise women\u2019s interests when voting. To that I say, women could also prioritize men\u2019s best interests when voting. After all, every man who has ever voted would not have been able to vote if his mother had not given him life. Besides, women bring a unique perspective that men are not capable of bringing and vice versa. Even if men prioritize women\u2019s best interests when voting, there may be certain things these men did not consider that a woman may have been more likely to consider. When the 19th amendment was ratified, a lot of people were mad about it. Nowadays, the vast majority of people agree that women should be allowed to vote. In fact, it seems kind of surprising that anyone would ever be against letting women vote. \n\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century, black where were oppressed by Jim Crow laws and other racist policies. In the supreme court case known as Plessey V Ferguson, it was ruled that, things that are for black people and things that are for white people could be separate, but they had to be equal. The problem of course is that a lot of the time, they where not equal. If you had one restaurant for whites and another for colored people, the bathrooms in the white restaurants would be cleaner, the cooks in the white restaurant would be more skilled and experienced, etc. Apparently, if a black man had just used the bathroom, there is something wrong with it. If a white man uses that same bathroom, the white man will become infected with the black man\u2019s germs. My thought process is this. If we allow separate but equal, there is a chance that the equal part will not be enforced very diligently. Therefore, in order to justify your belief in separate but equal, you must explain what is wrong with allowing whites and colored people to eat at the same restaurant or sit next to one another on the bus. Whatever terrible thing it is that will happen to a white person who sits next to a black person on the bus, will that same bad thing happen to a white person who sits next to another white person on the bus? If you say no, how do you figure? Plessey V Ferguson was overturned in a case known as Brown V Board of Education. These days, most of us are amazed that anyone would think that a white person using the same public restroom as a black person is inherently harmful. \n\nFifty years ago, most Americans felt that gay people should not be allowed to marry and adopt. Now, pretty much everyone who considers themselves liberal, is in favor of extending full equal rights to homosexuals. The percentage of Republicans, who oppose gay rights, is becoming smaller by the year. \n\nFifty years from now, I am confident that those who oppose gay marriage will be seen the same way that people who oppose inter racial marriage are seen today. These people will still exist, but they will be a small minority of people and most of us will be amazed that anyone is or ever has been opposed to same sex marriage. After all, the purpose of laws is to protect people from harm. That is not to say that, just because a behavior has the potential to harm people, that it should necessarily be illegal. However, only if a behavior is potentially harmful should it be illegal. Any and all behaviors that do not have the potential to harm people should be legal. Therefore, laws stating that marriage licenses can only be issued to opposite sex couples and cannot be issued to same sex couples is fundamentally illogical for the same reason that it would be illogical to have a law prohibiting wearing a green shirt in public all the while it is totally legal to wear a red shirt in public. Anything (whether it be good, bad or neutral) that could happen as a result of wearing a green shirt in public, could also happen if you wear a red shirt in public. Therefore, if the situation and context is such that you are allowed to wear a red shirt in public, then you should be allowed to wear a green shirt in public. Similarly, anything (good, bad or neutral) that could happen if a same sex couple gets married, could also happen if a sterile heterosexual couple gets married. I added the qualifier that we are talking specifically about sterile heterosexual unions, because same sex unions are 100% sterile, while heterosexual unions do in fact carry with them the potential to create new life. If being sterile does not preclude you from marrying someone of the opposite sex and\/or adopting a child, then same sex couples should also be allowed to marry and adopt.    \n",

And yet, in every major taxpayer-funded venture, the public is consistently left holding the bill while corporations rake in billions.\n\n**The Math Behind Social Security: An Avoidable Crisis**\n\nWhat really sparked this topic for me was a discussion I was having with my wife about Social Security, one of the most glaring examples of our broken system. Right now, there is a cap on how much income is subject to Social Security tax ($176,100 in 2025). This means that someone earning $176,100 pays the exact same amount into Social Security as someone making $1 million, $10 million, or even $100 million.\n\nLogically, if this cap were removed, high earners would contribute proportionally to their income, and Social Security's funding crisis would largely disappear. In fact, estimates suggest that simply taxing all income equally would extend Social Security's solvency for decades.\n\nSo why don\u2019t we do it? Because those with the most political influence, high earners and corporations, have successfully lobbied to keep this system in place, ensuring that the burden falls disproportionately on middle- and lower-income workers.\n\nOriginally, Social Security was supposed to function more like a long-term investment fund rather than a pay-as-you-go system. The original design intended for it to accumulate funds and generate returns over time. Instead, the money was immediately spent on benefits, and as a result, we've been funding it through new contributions rather than investment growth.\n\nHad we followed the originally intended formula, instead of having certain global investment firms with trillions of dollars in investment capital driving up inflation, we'd have Social Security invested in our economy, with that return ensuring future generations would be able to retire without worrying that they'll have to work until they're gone.\n\n**Where Public Money Goes, and Who Profits**\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t just Social Security. Taxpayer money is funneled into countless private enterprises with little to no accountability for returns. Here are just a few examples:\n\n1. **Corporate Bailouts:** During the 2008 financial crisis, the government bailed out banks with $700 billion in taxpayer money. Those banks quickly recovered and became massively profitable again, but did the public receive a return on their forced investment? No. The banks pocketed the profits, paid out executive bonuses, and then raised fees on the customers who paid for their bailout. This doesn't even count the car company bailouts or any of the other numerous other companies saved by taxpayer money.\n2. **Big Pharma and Government-Funded Research:** Many of the world\u2019s most profitable drugs were developed using taxpayer-funded research. Once these drugs hit the market, pharmaceutical companies slap on astronomical price tags. The public, who funded the research, not only has to pay full price, but these companies often hike up prices on drugs they know that Medicare and Medicaid will pay for. Why aren\u2019t these investments structured like venture capital deals, where the government retains a percentage of profits? You could probably fund Medicare with just fair dividends from the drugs taxpayers have paid to research.\n3. **Hollywood and Publicly Funded Productions:** Millions of taxpayer dollars go into film tax credits, military-funded productions, and subsidized studio infrastructure. Yet when a film makes hundreds of millions in profit, does the government receive a percentage? Absolutely not. Imagine if taxpayers had a stake in every blockbuster they funded proportionate to the tax dollars used to produce the film.\n4. **Stadium Construction:** A Perpetual Public Loss: Cities routinely shell out hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to build sports stadiums under the false promise of \"economic growth.\" In reality, these projects generate mostly low-wage jobs with little tax revenue to justify the expense. Many of the employees at these stadiums make so little that they end up on Medicaid and food stamps, so I highly doubt even the few jobs they produce manage to create a positive tax flow. Meanwhile, team owners, often billionaires, profit immensely, and then a few decades later, demand new taxpayer-funded stadiums. Instead of this endless cycle, why aren\u2019t cities demanding ownership stakes in these franchises? It would be a better benefit to taxpayers if these downtown stadiums were used to build parking lots instead. I'm not saying we shouldn't have sports teams, but if we're funding the stadiums, and they have enough money to sign enormous contracts with athletes (recently I saw one that was almost a billion dollars for one player), then why on earth is there not enough money to repay the cost of the stadium, at a bare minimum?\n\nA Simple, Fair Solution: Treat Public Spending Like Investment Capital\n\nIf a venture capital firm invests in a startup, they get equity. If a bank loans money, they demand collateral. If the government (taxpayers) funds a project, why is there no expectation of a financial return?\n\n**A fair public investment strategy would include:**\n\n* **Profit Shares:** If public money funds 20% of a business, the public should receive 20% of its net profits.\n* **Stock Ownership:** If taxpayer dollars bail out a corporation, the government should receive equity.\n* Dividends for Public Programs: Profits from publicly funded projects should be reinvested into Social Security, Medicare, and public infrastructure, not funneled into executive bonuses.\n\nI absolutely do not see this as government overreach; I see it as just common sense. Taxpayers should expect the same returns on investment that any private investor would demand. Taxpayer-funded programs have contributed greatly to the corporate side of the economy, why is it acceptable that our tax dollars become their paychecks while very few of them contribute anything in the way of taxes?\n\n**Why This Hasn\u2019t Happened, and How We Change It**\n\nThe only reason this system persists is because corporations have structured public spending to their advantage. Lobbyists ensure that taxpayer money keeps flowing with no strings attached, while politicians, many of whom engage in a form of legal insider trading, benefit directly from protecting corporate interests.\n\n**But this conversation needs to happen. Americans deserve to ask:**\n\n* Why are we funding billion-dollar corporations with no expectation of return?\n* Why do politicians resist removing the Social Security tax cap when it could fix the program's funding crisis?\n* Why are taxpayer-funded investments structured as giveaways instead of long-term public assets?\n* Why do we give money to corporations that don't pay taxes and are run by executives who also don't pay taxes when they give themselves the money we used to bail them out?\n\nIf we demand accountability in public spending, we could transform Social Security, fund public programs without increasing taxes, and finally break the cycle of corporate welfare disguised as economic policy.\n\nIt\u2019s time to start treating public investment like what it actually is: **an investment.**\n\nLet's face the truth, these corporations rarely pay taxes. There are so many tax loopholes out there that we dump billions of dollars into corporations that, at the end of the year, pay less taxes than the average employee at their own company.\n\nTaking an equity stake in public investments is likely the only way taxpayers will ever see any return on public investment. It's important to recognize that we're in deficit spending, which means every dollar of corporate welfare is money we don't even have. Why do we allow our children and grandchildren to be born into debt, ensuring executives are guaranteed generations of wealth for theirs?\n\nPersonally, I'm sick of promises to tax the rich that, in the end, just end up creating inflation we pay for everywhere, from the pump to the grocery store. This is the only way I see corporations ever actually paying their fair share without it becoming just another expense that they will add their profit margins to and dump right back on us to pay for them.\n\nHow much of Wall Street has been funded by taxpayers, but only the wealthiest people and politicians make anything off it? Imagine if those companies had publicly appointed representatives on their boards, similar to how government-funded agencies operate!\n\nHow much of our infrastructure was taxpayer-funded, but corporations make all the money off it?\n\nI'm sure many people can give countless more examples of taxpayer investments where the public saw no return.\n\nDoesn't this seem like something that could be framed as a net positive for enough people on both sides of the aisle to make it happen (eventually)?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",

FOX News constantly pushed the refrain that Obama would raise taxes to finance Obamacare -and that he wouldn't raise taxes on his rich friends. The right went crazy. The midterms were a bloodbath.  TEA partiers ran for office everywhere - and did REALLY well.\n\nThe name, TEA Party, was genius because it linked so nicely to the Boston Tea Party.  I'm not smart enough to think up something similar - but certainly someone in the Reddit world is.\n\nThe TEA party was all about reining in presidential power and government in general.  Every time Obama signed an executive order, the right went freaking nuts.\n\n'Up' is now officially 'down.'

It also reminds people that if we don't do something quick, we are doomed to be ruled by the rich.  \n\nAmconmichael pointed out that the TEA Party was really an anti Black president party.   I agree.  Their stated purpose was to push back against too much government power.  We have the same stated purpose, but technically, we would be an anti orange president party.  \n\nbrodievonorchard pointed out that the TEA Party was quickly astroturfed by the oil baron Koch bro pricks.  True - and Big Oil is still big shit - but if the TEA Party's true purpose was to thwart a Black president, then didn't that exact scenario just happen?  \n\nFitz\\_2112b points out that the TEA Party morphed into MAGA - which is now a face-eating leopard oligarchy.  True.  Are we saying that with the threat of astroturfing and leopard-face-eating, maybe we shouldn't go there? \n\nFuck it - if we do nothing, if we don't even try, we've already lost.

We have seen this time and again Republicans would do whatever shameless things needed to get what they wanted. \n\nI am mostly interested in newsletter because I can't physically stand seeing or hearing the orange felon. But I would love podcast recommendations too if they don't use clips of him (Rachel Maddow made a point not using any in her show last time around. Not sure if she's doing it now, but either way I can't handle her deep dive style of storytelling yet.)\n\nThanks!",

        "title":"Contradictory Conservatives: A Call for Reflection",
        "selftext":"\nI\u2019m not deeply entrenched in politics, nor do I hate conservatives or MAGA supporters as a group. I prefer to judge individuals based on their character and actions. That said, I\u2019ve observed what feels like a significant transformation within the conservative movement over the past 16 years.\n\nIn the 2000s, the Republican Party seemed to stand on foundational principles\u2014issues like abortion, gun control, government overreach, and border security. These principles, while debatable, were often presented with a degree of respect and thoughtfulness. The rise of Trump, however, ushered in a new era of conservatism. It feels more aggressive, less tethered to intellectual consistency, and more pervasive in our daily lives, thanks in part to platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nThis increased exposure has prompted me to examine conservative ideologies more critically, alongside their liberal counterparts. Through logical reasoning and exploring potential contradictions, I\u2019ve identified some striking paradoxes within the modern conservative movement. While these aren\u2019t novel insights, I hope to open a dialogue for further exploration and understanding.\n\nThe Pro-Life Paradox\n\nConservatives frequently champion a zero-tolerance approach to abortion. They argue that life begins at conception and that a fetus, regardless of development stage, has an inalienable right to life. For many, this belief is rooted in a sincere desire to protect innocent life. On its surface, this seems noble, even compelling. Most people, regardless of political affiliation, would agree that late-term abortions\u2014except in extreme cases\u2014should be restricted.\n\nYet, conservatives apply this logic inconsistently. If the moral imperative to protect life is so absolute, why is there no parallel outcry to address the leading cause of death among children and teenagers in the U.S.\u2014guns? Conservatives cling to the Second Amendment as if it\u2019s untouchable, yet their unwillingness to consider even modest reforms stands in stark contrast to their self-professed commitment to protecting life.\n\nThis inconsistency deepens when we examine their position on the future of the very fetuses they fight to save. Imagine a fetus they protect today grows up into a woman facing an unwanted pregnancy\u2014perhaps due to assault, health risks, or financial instability. The same conservatives who fought for her right to be born would now deny her autonomy, forcing her to carry a pregnancy to term, regardless of the consequences.\n\nIf the pro-life movement truly values life, why isn\u2019t there a push for universal pre-K, affordable childcare, or free school lunch programs? Where is the investment in the well-being of American youth? Instead, we see an intense focus on banning drag show readings while programs that directly benefit children languish.\n\nThis raises the question: do conservatives truly value life, or is their interest in protecting the unborn merely a means to exert control over personal freedoms?\n\nThe Trump Contradiction\n\nTrump\u2019s presidency and influence have brought contradictions within the conservative movement into sharp focus. For instance, conservatives cheered Trump\u2019s recent executive order to repeal electric vehicle mandates, celebrating his commitment to oil and gas. Yet, the advisor he tapped for this initiative is the CEO of the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle manufacturer. How does this align with their narrative?\n\nConsider Trump\u2019s actions on TikTok. In 2020, he signed an executive order to ban the app, citing national security concerns over Chinese ownership. Conservatives rallied behind him, lauding his toughness on China. Fast forward to today, and TikTok\u2019s reinstatement is celebrated as a victory for free speech. Conveniently forgotten is Trump\u2019s role in the original ban, as is the fact that a major American investor in TikTok is one of his donors.\n\nThe contradictions extend to immigration, one of Trump\u2019s hallmark issues. In February 2024, a bipartisan border bill was proposed. The legislation would have tightened asylum standards and automatically secured the border if illegal crossings exceeded certain thresholds. Trump, however, opposed the bill, calling it a \u201cgift to the Democrats.\u201d Following his condemnation, Senate Republicans abandoned it, and the bill failed. Conservatives who revere Trump as the ultimate defender of the border have remained silent about his role in blocking legislation that could have reduced illegal immigration.\n\nThe Larger Question\n\nThese are just a few examples of what I see as glaring contradictions within the conservative movement. How can conservatives reconcile being pro-life while disregarding the lives of pregnant women, children, and teens killed by gun violence? How do they explain supporting a president whose actions often undermine the very principles they claim to hold dear?\n\nI don\u2019t ask these questions to inflame or mock but to encourage meaningful dialogue. I want to hear from you. Share your thoughts, provide your perspectives, and help deepen this conversation. Perhaps together, we can untangle the inconsistencies and better understand the ideological shifts at play.\n\nTL;DR: Conservatives claim to value life but demonstrate contradictory priorities on abortion, gun control, and support for Trump. Let\u2019s discuss these contradictions and their implications.",

        "selftext":"It\u2019s my understanding that gun advocates sometimes use the 1857 *Dred Scott v. Sandford*\u00a0([link](https:\/\/supreme.justia.com\/cases\/federal\/us\/60\/393\/#tab-opinion-1964281)) decision to make the argument that the second amendment guarantees an individual right to own guns.  Just a few examples of 2A advocates making this argument are [this video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/2W8sppSylVU?si=Nc8sFW1RGujByEjl&amp;t=129), [this video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/neLdsW7XZSM?si=5wz8HCrInl1s6KCi&amp;t=605), and [this video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/6vglHW9q2Ek?si=DUs36IP8dXJ6Sp6G&amp;t=101), as well as written examples such as these: [link 1](https:\/\/www.independent.org\/news\/article.asp?id=345),[ link 2](https:\/\/www.law.georgetown.edu\/mcrp-journal\/blog\/the-second-amendment-is-racist-why-bruen-should-have-been-decided-on-equal-protection-grounds\/),[ link 3](https:\/\/harvardlawreview.org\/forum\/vol-135\/racist-gun-laws-and-the-second-amendment\/).  In fact, even Justice Clarence Thomas connects *Dred Scott* to the second amendment in his opinion for *NYSRPA vs Bruen* ([link](https:\/\/supreme.justia.com\/cases\/federal\/us\/597\/20-843\/#tab-opinion-4600259)).  Most of their argument seems to stem from this excerpt from the opinion in that case written by Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney:\n\n&gt;More especially, it cannot be believed that the large slaveholding States regarded them as included in the word citizens, or would have consented to a Constitution which might compel them to receive them in that character from another State. For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety. **It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they went.** And all of this would be done in the face of the subject race of the same color, both free and slaves, and inevitably producing discontent and insubordination among them, and endangering the peace and safety of the State.\n\nThe portion I\u2019ve put in bold appears to be what some argue is a synopsis of the federal Bill of Rights, and the statement saying \u201cand to keep and carry arms wherever they went\u201d appears to be a reference to\u00a0the second amendment. \u00a0Gun advocates would argue that if the Supreme Court in 1857 believed that the second amendment guaranteed a citizen an individual right to keep and carry a gun, then this must also have been the traditional and authentic interpretation of that amendment.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t understand how this argument is valid. \u00a0It seems to me that one could only come to the aforementioned conclusion if one has not actually read the context in which the above paragraph appears.  Earlier, Justice Taney had begun his opinion by presenting a list of state laws which placed explicit restrictions upon the rights and privileges of the black populations of the respective states. \u00a0These laws dated from colonial times through to the then-present day. \u00a0Taney\u2019s reasoning was essentially that it made no sense for a \u201cnegro\u201d that was a slave or a descendant of slaves imported from Africa to become a citizen, because the sum of all of the discriminatory and prohibitive laws that had been passed against the black populations strongly indicates that it had been the general will of the individual states to subjugate the black populations in the interest of public peace and security. \u00a0And when the individual states ratified the Constitution in order to join into a union under a federal government, the individual states vested to the federal government the protection of their peace and safety; and thus, it would be inappropriate for the federal government to betray this trust by giving citizenship to a demographic which the individual states themselves had seen fit to subjugate. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0Among the list of discriminatory laws he mentions, the first is a 1717 law from Maryland which declared\n\n&gt;\u201dthat if any free negro or mulatto intermarry with any white woman, or if any white man shall intermarry with any negro or mulatto woman, such negro or mulatto shall become a slave during life, excepting mulattoes born of white women, who, for such intermarriage, shall only become servants for seven years, to be disposed of as the justices of the county court where such marriage so happens shall think fit, to be applied by them towards the support of a public school within the said county. And any white man or white woman who shall intermarry as aforesaid with any negro or mulatto, such white man or white woman shall become servants during the term of seven years, and shall be disposed of by the justices as aforesaid, and be applied to the uses aforesaid.\"\n\n\u00a0Then he mentions a 1705 Massachusetts law which declared that\n\n&gt;\"if any negro or mulatto shall presume to smite or strike any person of the English or other Christian nation, such negro or mulatto shall be severely whipped, at the discretion of the justices before whom the offender shall be convicted.\"\n\n\u00a0And another law from the same state declares\n\n&gt;\"that none of her Majesty's English or Scottish subjects, nor of any other Christian nation, within this province, shall contract matrimony with any negro or mulatto; nor shall any person, duly authorized to solemnize marriage, presume to join any such in marriage, on pain of forfeiting the sum of fifty pounds; one moiety thereof to her Majesty, for and towards the support of the Government within this province, and the other moiety to him or them that shall inform and sue for the same, in any of her Majesty's courts of record within the province, by bill, plaint, or information.\"\n\n\u00a0He later on mentions a 1774 Connecticut provision\n\n&gt;by which any negro, Indian, or mulatto servant who was found wandering out of the town or place to which he belonged without a written pass such as is therein described was made liable to be seized by anyone, and taken before the next authority to be examined and delivered up to his master -- who was required to pay the charge which had accrued thereby. And a subsequent section of the same law provides that if any free negro shall travel without such pass, and shall be stopped, seized, or taken up, he shall pay all charges arising thereby. And this law was in full operation when the Constitution of the United States was adopted, and was not repealed till 1797. So that, up to that time, free negroes and mulattoes were associated with servants and slaves in the police regulations established by the laws of the State.\n\n\u00a0And then another Connecticut law in 1833 which\u2026\n\n&gt;made it penal to set up or establish any school in that State for the instruction of persons of the African race not inhabitants of the State, or to instruct or teach in any such school or\u00a0institution, or board or harbor for that purpose, any such person without the previous consent in writing of the civil authority of the town in which such school or institution might be.\n\n\u00a0Justice Taney mentions a provision in New Hampshire \u00a0in 1815, in which\n\n&gt;no one was permitted to be enrolled in the militia of the State but free white citizens, and the same provision is found in a subsequent collection of the laws made in 1855. Nothing could more strongly mark the entire repudiation of the African race. The alien is excluded because, being born in a foreign country, he cannot be a member of the community until he is naturalized. But why are the African race, born in the State, not permitted to share in one of the highest duties of the citizen? The answer is obvious; he is not, by the institutions and laws of the State, numbered among its people. He forms no part of the sovereignty of the State, and is not therefore called on to uphold and defend it.\n\n\u00a0And finally he mentions an 1822 Rhode Island law\n\n&gt;forbidding persons who were authorized to join persons in marriage from joining in marriage any white person with any negro, Indian, or mulatto, under the penalty of two hundred dollars, and declaring all such marriages absolutely null and void, and the same law was again reenacted in its revised code of 1844. So that, down to the last-mentioned period, the strongest mark of inferiority and degradation was fastened upon the African race in that State.\n\n\u00a0It is after his list of such restrictive and discriminatory laws that Justice Taney extrapolates that if it was the will of the states to exclude the black population from the status of citizenship within each of their respective dominions, then it is only appropriate that the same demographic be excluded from citizenship by the national government into which the respective states had vested their collective interests. \u00a0As Taney states,\n\n&gt;For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police\u00a0regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety.\n\n\u00a0And then it is here where Taney states the excerpt which pro-gun advocates so often emphasize:\n\n&gt;It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, *and to keep and carry arms wherever they went*.\n\nUpon looking at the larger context of this excerpt, it would seem that the excerpt doesn\u2019t actually mean what the pro-gun advocates interpret it to mean. \u00a0First of all, it would seem that some of the items within this excerpt correlate with the prohibitive laws previously mentioned. \u00a0The first is when he mentions \u201cthe right to enter every other State whenever they pleased\u00a0. . . without pass or passport\u00a0. . . .\u201d \u00a0This correlates with the aforementioned 1774 Connecticut provision that required people of color to carry a pass when wandering outside the town of their residence. \u00a0And the second correlated item is -- in my interpretation -- the infamous line \u201cand to keep and carry arms wherever they went\u201d. \u00a0\u00a0I understand this line to be an allusion to the 1815 New Hampshire law which limited the right of militia duty to only free white citizens of the state. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nGun-rights advocates would likely interpret the latter line to refer to the text of the second amendment, and to refer to an individual right to own and carry guns for private purposes, such as self defense or sport. \u00a0However, it makes no sense for the line \u201cto keep and carry arms wherever they went\u201d to refer to the text of the second amendment. \u00a0Even though this line may sound similar to the line \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms\u201d, they are not the same, and the differences between the two are not at all negligible. \u00a0First of all, the second amendment refers to the right to \u201cbear arms\u201d, while the line from *Dred Scott*\u00a0says \u201ccarry arms\u201d. \u00a0The modern reader may simply see these two phrases as synonymous, but they are not. \u00a0The meaning of \u201ccarry arms\u201d is straightforward, consisting of a transitive verb acting upon a noun; but the phrase \u201cbear arms\u201d does not actually refer to the carrying of arms, but rather is itself a phrasal verb and an idiomatic expression. \u00a0According to the Oxford English Dictionary -- the most authoritative resource on the English language -- the expression \u201cbear arms\u201d originated around AD 1325, and is correlated with the Latin phrase *arma ferre*, likely being simply a direct translation of the Latin. \u00a0Also according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the phrase is defined simply as \u201cTo serve as a soldier; to fight (for a country, cause, etc.).\u201d  The sense of the phrase \"the right to bear arms\" in the sense that pro-gun advocates typically use the phrase is, according to the Oxford dictionary, an originally and chiefly American re-definition of the phrase, originating circa 1776.  Hence, the second amendment references the right of the people to keep arms and *to fight* and\/or *serve as a soldier*; while the *Dred Scott* line instead references the right to keep arms and carry arms.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, the *Dred Scott* line also differs from the second amendment by including the modifier \u201cwherever they went\u201d. \u00a0No such modifier exists in the second amendment. \u00a0In fact, the second amendment is merely a prohibitive provision, one which is applied against Congress itself, and does not directly apply any affirmative granting of rights to the people. \u00a0It makes no sense to interpret an absolute prohibition against Congress as somehow establishing a modified affirming of rights to the people. \u00a0Because of these linguistic and textual details, it is, at best, quite a stretch to claim that the phrase \u201cand to keep and carry arms wherever they went\u201d is somehow a meaningful reference to the second amendment.\n\nSome might alternatively argue that the line, rather than referring to the text of the second amendment specifically, is instead referring to the liberty of private gun use in general. \u00a0But what makes much more sense is that the line \u201cand to keep and carry arms wherever they went\u201d, instead of referring to private gun use, actually refers to militia duty. \u00a0It was customary in early America for militiamen to possess arms -- such as muskets or rifles -- in their personal custody (i.e. \u201cto keep arms\u201d), and to literally carry them wherever they went. \u00a0We can see evidence of this from numerous militia-related laws from early America from colonial times until the 20th\u00a0century. \u00a0On example is a New York law from 1640:\n\n&gt;ORDINANCE\n\n&gt;Of the Director and Council of New Netherland, providing for the Arming and mustering of the Militia in case of danger.\u00a0Passed\u00a09\u00a0May, 1640.\n\n&gt;\\[N.Y. Col. MSS.

and the phrase \u201cto keep and carry arms wherever they went\u201d does not represent the second amendment directly; for these reasons, there is simply no argument that this passage from *Dred Scott* supports second amendment rights. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nOf the four stated civil rights, it would appear that Justice Taney mentions two of them as allusions to previously mentioned statutes: the line \u201cand to keep and carry arms wherever they went\u201d correlates to the aforementioned 1815 New Hampshire militia law which excluded black people from militia service; and an even more obvious connection is made between the line \u201cthe right to enter every other State whenever they pleased\u00a0. . . without pass or passport\u201d and the 1774 Connecticut law requiring black people to carry a pass while traveling. \u00a0\n\nThe other two stated civil rights -- freedom of speech and the right to hold public meetings -- appear to be outliers of this pattern, as they appear to have been mentioned without any aforementioned precedent in state law. \u00a0However, there might still be a particular reason why Justice Taney saw fit to mention these particular rights. \u00a0It so happens that\u00a0most of the items listed in the bolded excerpt\u00a0are also stipulated in the Declaration of Rights in the 1820 Missouri State Constitution. \u00a0This is especially relevant since the *Dred Scott* case centered on whether the plaintiff was still considered a slave in the slave state of Missouri after having gained his freedom after traveling to the free state of Illinois.\u00a0\u00a0Notably, the two outlier items are also addressed in the Missouri Constitution.\n\nThe statement\u00a0from *Dred Scott*\u00a0which says\u00a0\u201cand it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak\u201d appears to correlate with Article 13, Clause 16:\n\n&gt;That the free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the invaluable rights of man, and that every person may freely speak, write, and print, on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.\n\n\u00a0And the statement \u201cto hold public meetings upon political affairs\u201d appears to correlate with Article 13, Clause 2:\n\n&gt;That the people of this state have the inherent, sole, and exclusive right of regulating the internal government and police thereof, and of altering and abolishing their constitution and form of government, whenever it may be necessary to their safety and happiness.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to their connection to the discriminatory laws already established within the text of *Dred Scott*,\u00a0the remaining two items from the excerpt also appear to have correlates in the Missouri Constitution as well. \u00a0The statement about the right of a citizen \u201cto enter every other State whenever they pleased\u201d appears to correlate with a clause in Article 3, section 26:\n\n&gt;It shall be their \\[the general assembly\u2019s\\] duty, as soon as may be, to pass such laws as may be necessary--1. To prevent free negroes and mulattoes from coming to and settling in this State, under any pretext whatsoever;\n\n\u00a0And it also\u00a0seems\u00a0to correlate with Article 13, Clause 21:\n\n&gt;\u00a0That migration from this state cannot be prohibited.\n\nAnd the statement \u201cand to keep and carry arms wherever they went\u201d appears to correlate with\u00a0the state arms provision in\u00a0part of Article 13, Clause 3:\n\n&gt;that their right to bear arms, in defense of themselves and of the state, cannot be questioned.\n\nCompared to the second amendment, this arms provision in the Missouri Constitution seems more pertinent to the arms statement mentioned in the *Dred Scott*\u00a0decision, since this provision specifically qualifies the lawful purposes for which the right to bear arms may be exercised, which the second amendment does not do.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSome might say that it only makes sense that Justice Taney is referring to the federal Bill of Rights in the bolded excerpt because he is speaking on behalf of the United States Supreme Court, which is a federal body. \u00a0However, this interpretation is uninformed. \u00a0When we look at the actual context of the *Dred Scott* decision, it is clear that the particular point that Justice Taney is making in that excerpt pertains much more to state law than to federal law. \u00a0Even though the decision that Justice Taney is making is a federal decision, he is clearly making this federal decision based on state premises.\n\nIt has never been the primary prerogative of the federal government to grant rights to American citizens.  It is state governments that have the primary authority and function of specifying and granting civil rights.  Hence, Justice Taney wasn't saying that making black people into citizens -- at the federal level -- would give them rights; his point was that federally making black people into citizens would effectively negate the prohibitive laws that the states have established in order to subjugate their black populations.  In other words, making black people into citizens would create a kind of \"double negative\" whose effect is a positive: it would not actually give them anything, but instead would *take away* the laws that *take away* their liberties.  The verbiage \"it would *give* to persons of the negro race...\" is hence metaphorical rather than literal.  It's like if a judge were to exonerate a convicted prison inmate through DNA evidence: the judge isn't actually *giving* the inmate his freedom; the judge is just *removing* his incarceration.  Thus, it is merely the result of a quirk of language and rhetoric that Justice Taney *appears* to be affirming that American citizens are entitled to the liberty to keep and carry arms wherever they go.  But for gun advocates to take this rhetoric literally, as they often do, is simply a wrong conclusion to draw\n\nAs for the content of the bolded excerpt, I can\u2019t say how purposeful or how arbitrary this particular assortment of rights was meant to be. \u00a0At least two of the four items appear to be references to state laws which he had previously referenced, yet he breaks this pattern with the other two items, which do not have any statutory precursor in *Dred Scott*; and there are even more state laws referenced earlier that he *does not*\u00a0allude to in the bolded list. \u00a0And furthermore, all of the items in the list could be said to have correlates in the 1820 Missouri Constitution; but it is not clear whether Justice Taney was actually alluding to that constitution in particular -- because of its relevance to the case at hand, or if he was referencing any other state constitution. \u00a0In summary, I don\u2019t know exactly why Justice Taney chose the particular list of items that he chose in the bolded excerpt of his majority opinion in *Dred Scott*; however, I can say with much more confidence what this excerpt *does not* indicate. \u00a0He is not referencing the federal Bill of Rights as a whole; he is not referencing the second amendment in particular; and he is likely not referencing the general liberty of private firearm rights. \u00a0Therefore, there is no basis for pro-gun advocates to use this case as a means to argue for firearm rights. \u00a0\n\nWhat are your thoughts about my argument?",

It twists your desire for normalcy into a weapon and turns it back on you. If you do not speak out or act against it, you are complicit in it. It cannot be voted away (if that\u2019s not already obvious). Patience and \u201cunderstanding\u201d are its fuel. The Nazi does not speak in your language; its only form of communication is fear and violence. You cannot \u201cwait it out,\u201d as no amount of blood can satiate it. It isn\u2019t tied to a single person or party\u2014though it often prefers the right\u2014it will inhabit whatever host isn\u2019t actively fighting it. It is, in effect, a living, breathing villain with unlimited time and resources at its disposal\u2014like Satan.  \n  \nFour hundred thousand American grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and others gave their lives fighting fascism, with many millions more gravely injured or scarred by trauma. Many of us have seen the legacy of this damage firsthand. The absurdity of a man now making the hand gesture meant to praise Hitler and swear loyalty to him spits on that sacrifice. In fact, \u201cspits on\u201d is an understatement; it\u2019s the biggest \u201cfuck you\u201d I can imagine being made to a veteran of that era.  \n  \nAnd because no block of text on an issue of this magnitude is complete without an adjoining quote:  \n\u201cIf there are nine people and one Nazi at a table, there are ten Nazis at the table.\u201d",

When (predictably) asked if they will target Cartel in Mexico, Trump said \"Maybe\" and that \"stranger things have happened\" along with a promise \"to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gang criminal networks.\"  When asked how M\u00e9xico may feel about it, Trump said to ask them how they feel (I am anxiously awaiting Sheinbaum's response).\n\nI personally have been keeping up with Sheinbaum as a president, and she is very serious. She is Mexico's 2nd leftist president in decades, the first being her predecesor Obrador (AMLO). The interesting thing is that Obrador cleaned up a ton of government corruption and illegal activity, embezzlement etc. The Cartel is still active (in some areas more than others) but it's not close to how bad it was 30+ years ago. Sheinbaum is more leftist than he is and is furthering what he started. But make no mistake she is very no-nonsense and has clearly been preparing for whatever the U.S. may try once Trump took office. They have been moving Mexico to be less dependent on the U.S. by increasing domestic productions and trading with europe\n\nSo, *when* the U.S. inevitably kills Mexican citizens in Mexico because the U.S. has designated them terrorists, what happens next? Mexico very well could consider it an act of terrorism themselves, or just an act of outright war.\n\n",

        "selftext":"Gavin Newsom will be termed out in 2026. The Conservatives kept mentioning him as a possible replacement for Joe Biden in the 2024 election. I suspect they are expecting him to run in 2028 and are already gearing up a smear campaign to knock him out of the primaries. \n\nRight now they are blaming the fires on Democrat leadership. My guess is that the Conservatives, who now basically run the GOP will find a conservative candidate to run for Governor in 2026. This candidate will no doubt be endorsed by Trump. \n\nOnce Trump officially takes office, I expect Comer and Jordan to launch the first investigation of the year against Newsom and the Mayor of L.A (a Black female Democrat). It will be a show trial that doesn\u2019t solve anything. The main purpose is to make the people of California think the Democrats are idiots. If it works is a different story. \n\nWhat I find funny is how hypocritical the conservatives are. During the election they hated the \u201cHollywood elites\u201d. Now they sympathize with them for losing the their million dollar homes. Building reservoirs and new fire hydrants will be the \u201clow egg and gas prices\u201d of the 2026 California election. \nRant over. ",

        "selftext":"I'm sure this has already been discussed and I missed it, so hard to keep up with everything.\n\nBut, what do you all think? Should we all quit Meta? I mean, I've been wanting to reduce my time spent on social media for a while now and all that anyway. And these latest decisions could absolutely be justification I finally needed. I certainly don't like the idea that me eyeballs are generating any revenue for Zuckerberg. I already dropped Twitter for Bluesky a while ago. So, one way of looking it is we should take the high road and just #exitmeta. And when this news first broke that was my first instinct. I posted statuses saying I was leaving and that everyone could find me on Bluesky, deleted the apps off my phone, did all that.\n\nBut another way to look at it is that that's letting them win. There's been a lot of talk about how one of the big reasons that Republicans keep winning elections is that they're winning the information war. Somehow, despite us supposedly being the party of young, smart and tech savvy people, they've beat us at the online (mis)information game. We can have a totally completely different discussion on why that is, what we could have done differently but it's true. So maybe we shouldn't quit Meta. Maybe now it's up to us to double down and fight there. To all dedicate some time to add these \"community notes\" that they're going to use instead. To make sure that actual real news gets liked and shared as much as possible. Plus, a lot of my local activist organizations still use IG as their primary way of organizing. Maybe some will move to Bluesky or something else, but so far I haven't seen a huge exit by them or anything.\n\n\nUPDATE: A majority of these replies have either been \"I never joined,\" or \"I quit years ago.\" Which kind of speaks to my biggest concern. If none of us are on social media to combat misinformation then more people, young people, fresh voters, will be exposed to it and radicalized. I was really shocked about how much Trump improved with young and first time voters. But once you realize they get most of their information from Instagram and TikTok, and we've all abandoned those platforms with our typical scoldy, judgemental attitude towards them and people that still use them, what did we think was going to happen?

The ending of Trump's first election interference case has officially proved that notion false. No president had ever tested the limits of presidential immunity like this, and it is now proven that a president is given leniencies for their crimes, putting a potential 4 year sentencing to zero. Not a fine, not community service, ZERO. The fact that a sentencing even took place today was a surprise to just about everybody, especially since it was revealed that SC Justice Alito had a personal phone call with Trump the *day before* Trump requested a delay in sentencing with the supreme court.\n\n What Trump has been allowed to get away with just since he has left office has completely broken the judicial system. He was allowed to use stall tactics with no merits, again and again and again while the judges just kept going along with it. Held in contempt 10 times for violating gag orders, posting about the judge, their family, the jury, etc. As the prosecutor put it, Trump was \"relentless\" in his attacks on the cases, all parties involved, and even the rule of law itself. He has done irreparable damage to how the law is viewed and how it is applied. And he was able to do all of this while *not* being president, meaning as an ex-president he was given extreme leniencies that allowed him to go 6+ months after conviction to sentencing. This is (as far as I know) unprecedented even in New York City. \n\nOn the bigger scale, Trump was convicted of election interference, creating a plan to prevent information from being released that would impact the electio, and falsifying business records to hide it. All the evidence is overwhelming and decisive. What to speak of all of the evidence in his multiple other criminal cases. And now he is President-Elect, and we all have to pretend none of that exists anymore because he won a popularity contest. \n\nThroughout all of the court proceedings for the criminal activities of Trump, he has always argued presidential immunity, even if it is clearly not in the \"official\" scope of presidential immunity. So, clearly there is an \"unofficial\" scope of presidential immunity that might just be up to the discretion of the judge? But then of course, that leads us to the highest court in the land, an un-elected board of appointed judges that for the long foreseeable future have been shaped by the felon convicted of election interference and still currently on trial for more election interference across multiple jurisdictions.

        "selftext":"As of 2024, if you live in Wyoming, your vote carries about 3.7 times more weight in the presidential election than if you live in California. This disparity arises because each electoral vote (EV) in Wyoming represents approximately 194,690 people, while each EV in California represents about 721,670 people.\n\nI still think that the national popular vote should be determining the presidency, regardless of which party benefits. The common argument against this\u2014that cities like New York or Los Angeles would dominate elections\u2014doesn\u2019t really hold much weight in reality. Only about 32.9% of the U.S. voting-age population resides in the ten largest metro areas. Even if every single person in these metro areas voted the same way (which they don\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t), the remaining 67.1% of the electorate still holds substantial influence.\n\nWhile the Electoral College is unlikely to be abolished, I think it should be adjusted to better reflect where people actually live. One potential solution is the \"Wyoming Rule,\" which proposes increasing the size of the U.S. House of Representatives so that the representative-to-population ratio aligns with the smallest state\u2014currently Wyoming. This adjustment would redistribute electoral votes more fairly:\n\nCalifornia - 71 EV (+33%)\n\nTexas - 53 EV (+34%)\n\nFlorida - 39 EV (+32%)\n\n...\n\nRhode Island - 4 EV (+0%)\n\nVermont - 3 EV (+0%)\n\nWyoming - 3 EV (+0%)\n\n**Total : 538 \\~&gt; 677 (+32%)**\n\nWould you support a reform like this? It doesn\u2019t inherently benefit one party over another; it simply makes votes more equal across states.\n\nIn fact, using the 2024 presidential election, under this new system:\n\nHarris has\u00a0**283**\u00a0easily locked EV's.\n\nTrump has\u00a0**275**\u00a0easily locked EV's.\n\nSwing states hold\u00a0**119**\u00a0EV's.",

        "title":"Questions about symbols, freedom of speech, nationalism",
        "selftext":"Apologies in advance for the rant. \nFor as long as I can remember I've been a big fan of the fact that the the US enshrined free speech in the constitution.  One of the few things I still find to be proud of here, we still mostly let people express themselves how they want.  As such I've also been very wary of people who want to use the power of the government or even social pressure to punish speech and certain kinds of expression that make them feel icky or doesn't agree with whatever they've had on a loop in their heads for the last 60 years.  I find fewer examples of those people scarier than the flag fanatics.  Nationalism has been alive and well in the US for a long time, but it just keeps growing like some kind of swollen, idiocy cancer.  It's frightening because it seems so pervasive, so obviously the opposite of the freedom of the individual that is central to the American ideal, and yet so many of our own citizens are so poorly educated in civics, and basic logic and critical thinking that they don't see the conflict between individual freedom, and laws that regulate speech or even their own insistence that *my* type of expression is protected, but yours isn't.  All over the US, people have American flags on display, all year round, sometimes lots of them.  Flags are fine. They're symbolic communication. It's a symbol of something important to the person who hung it up.  But with the American flag then there are the rules that come with it.  There are a host of them.  All of these rules are fine too.  They are very much like the rules of a religion, or the rules of a certain design esthetic. They may seem arbitrary, nonsensical, or completely superfluous to the uninitiated, but they all serve functions, and, nevertheless, they exist, someone thought of them, wrote them down and others like them. Many people follow these rules.  That is also just fine.  It's when these people insist that everyone else must also follow their flag rules - that is, strict rules about the proper handling of special pieces of colored fabric, we're not talking about organ transplants or unexplored ordinance, here, just nicely decorated cloth - that they have crossed a line.  Why don't they see it?  Your religion says you must do these things and mustn't do those things.  By being a member of that religion, you are following the rules you set down for yourself.  You can't mandate those rules for others.  Are these flag nuts the same people who want to tell me what I can and can't do with my body?   Are they the same people who want public libraries and schools to ban certain books they don't like?  How can they be such proud devotees of \"America\" and completely oblivious to the Incompatability of personal freedom and restrictions on expression?  Some such \"proud Americans\" living near me have said that people who burn the flag in protest should be thrown in prison for life, be physically tortured, raped and killed.  Many agreed.  I suggested that seems like harsh treatment for someone who is destroying a piece of cloth that is not stolen property, and is identical to hundreds of millions of other pieces of cloth like it.  In fact I said it shouldn't be punished at all, and is actually a protected form of expression, ie free speech.  They called me a piece of shit.  Oh they railed at me.  These lunatics crawled out of the woodwork to type in all caps at me because clearly I'm the idiot. And I don't care about that.  Call me an idiot piece of shit, call me a cunt and a whore, call me a nazi or terrorist or whatever.  It's their right to call me whatever because they have the right to free speech.  I'm glad they can call me whatever they want without fear of being arrested for blasphemy or some other medieval bullshit.  But seriously, Who tf are these psychos?  Did no one else listen in 7th grade social studies?  Did none of them make the connection between pride and nationalism, and between censorship and fascism?  I'm so grossly disappointed in all of us.  If you told me when I was that 7th grader (long long time ago now) that our country was this full of morons I wouldn't have believed you.  I think the country's average IQ now has dropped into hypothermic territory, and scarier still is I don't have much hope that we'll ever be able to fix it.  I can't see any path for us to move forward with a populace that is this dumb-as-fuck.  It's not fun to be an average cow in a herd stampedeing toward a cliff, realizing that we're all going to plummet to our deaths if we don't change course, and screaming at the rest of the cattle to turn but your herd mates are all too fucking stupid to listen. \n\/rant",

My big huge family ? never ever going to another Christmas or thanksgiving or gathering like that\u2019s a really big commitment . to never have family again , there are maybe a select few I would stick around for like my little sis or grandmas but for the most part I just feel hatred for most of them so I guess my biggest dilemma is how can I keep these people in my life ..look at them and smile and make small talk when I have all this anger and sadness built up towards them \u2026 and before anyone says to just talk to them I\u2019d have to let you know I can not do that atleast not until after a million therapy sessions and maybe some anxiety meds because confrontation is my biggest fear so I\u2019m a very long ways away from doing that route \ud83e\udd76\n",

It is going to be full of nonsense people here would find appalling. The intent is to really make fun of people who would agree with the story line.\n\nAs AI puts it, this will be a romance novel with emotionally satisfying storytelling that aligns with traditional values - featuring strong family themes, faith elements, and relationships that develop within moral boundaries. I am throwing in xenophobia, sexism and anti-LGBTQ elements to reflect the nonsense these people seem to believe in.\n\nAs a side note, this will be significantly aided by AI. Also, I am writing this as a test run before I write something more substantial and something I actually believe in.\n\nAll that said, if I were to share my progress as I go through the process of creating this piece of nonsense, what subreddit would be better suited for it?",

They will have the power to decide unilaterally and disregard civil rights and due process.\n\nIt will start with the undocumented immigrants they locate.. then find people who are expendable or have criminal records, people with addictions or that have had govt assistance, down to people that just aren't \"American\" enough, dangers or non-patriots.. they will be rounded up to be \"reformed.\" They'll use camps for these people and work their way down the list until you have his side, and those suffering doing Chinese\/gulag\/gestapo-style govt labor to achieve forever power and control over us. You can change the terms and methods but let's assume they can do what they want, because they have everything they need now to do so.\n\nThink it's crazy? Conspiracy? Yeah I get it but sometimes we see things before they happen and never listen to the ones who warned us. But it's all in the 2025 playbook and we've been here before. This time only the people can stop it, but that won't happen when we're scared and shut in our homes asking for help, saying yeah but not MY family right?\n\nAll they need to do is what I've been saying for years, declare another seemingly needed, but ultimately bullshit \"war..\" \n\nI think this time it will be the \"war on immigration\" or something so they can make up emergency war time acts\/laws.. just like the war on terror. Which was how we got the patriot act..  remember that? Civil liberties trampled on, privacy violated. We were scared, so they were allowed to quell our fears, but what they were really doing was not targeted at terror and our enemies, but at Americans themselves. \n\nPeople are scared again, and just like COVID you get rich by causing a problem and selling the solution. This time I truly feel like they're going to take everything from us.. and what I fear more is that they know we can't sustain our population anymore, and they intend to close ranks, save themselves, and watch the rest of us slowly fade into genocidal memory. \n\nBut I'm crazy of course to say this so fuck me right?",

        "title":" Democrats that said they don't vote because they live in an area that's always red, and their vote doesn't matter. ",
        "selftext":"**About 86 million eligible voters didn\u2019t vote in the last election.**\n\nIf you're one of them that didn\u2019t vote because you feel like your voice doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m not here to blame or attack you. It\u2019s easy to feel powerless in a system that often feels stacked against us. My point is simple: you matter more than you might think. Even if your candidate doesn\u2019t win, when you show up, others in your community will see they\u2019re not alone. Maybe your vote could inspire them to show up next time.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at why every vote matters, even in areas perceived as overwhelmingly red.\n\n# Example 1: [Glascock County, Georgia](https:\/\/results.sos.ga.gov\/results\/public\/glascock-county-ga\/elections\/2024NovGen)\n\n* **Registered voters:** 2,073\n* **Turnout:** 81% (1,682 ballots cast)\n* **Didn\u2019t vote:** 391\n   * **Trump:** 1,534 (91.86%)\n   * **Kamala Harris:** 133 (7.96%)\n\nEven if all 391 non-voters had shown up and voted for Kamala, giving her **524 votes**, Trump still would have won. In counties like these, it\u2019s easy to feel like voting is futile.\n\n# Example 2: [Baker County, Georgia](https:\/\/results.sos.ga.gov\/results\/public\/baker-county-ga\/elections\/2024NovGen)\n\n* **Registered voters:** 2,066\n* **Turnout:** 72% (1,486 ballots cast)\n* **Didn\u2019t vote:** 580\n   * **Trump:** 883 (59.82%)\n   * **Kamala Harris:** 590 (39.97%)\n\nIf just **444 of the 580 non-voters** had shown up and voted for Kamala, she would have won. It\u2019s not impossible to imagine enough of those remaining voters choosing Kamala to secure the win.\n\nEven if your candidate doesn\u2019t win, increasing turnout changes perceptions. For example, in Glascock County, **1534 vs. 524** sends a stronger message than **1534 vs. 133.** It shows Democrats have local support, making progressive voices less isolated. This visibility can energize communities, spark deeper discussions, and even sway centrists or independents in future elections.\n\nIt\u2019s not lost on me that counties are part of larger congressional districts, where votes across multiple counties determine outcomes for House seats and electoral votes. For example, there\u2019s an entire section of Georgia that voted blue in the last election but turned red in this one. If just one county in that area turns blue again, it could create a ripple effect, shifting the district\u2019s votes back to blue in future elections.\n\nEvery vote contributes to a bigger picture\u2014it\u2019s not just about winning today, but about shaping tomorrow\u2019s outcomes.\n\nThe one thing I want you to take from this: You matter.\n\nDisclaimer: This 86 million estimate only includes those who were eligible to vote. People unable to vote due to [Administration Barrier Roles](https:\/\/www.brennancenter.org\/issues\/ensure-every-american-can-vote\/vote-suppression\/voter-id), [incarceration](https:\/\/bjs.ojp.gov\/library\/publications\/prisoners-2022-statistical-tables),[ felony convictions](https:\/\/www.sentencingproject.org\/reports\/locked-out-2022-estimates-of-people-denied-voting-rights\/), [mental incapacitation](https:\/\/stateline.org\/2018\/03\/21\/thousands-lose-right-to-vote-under-incompetence-laws\/), [homelessness](https:\/\/endhomelessness.org\/homelessness-in-america\/homelessness-statistics\/state-of-homelessness\/), or[ living in U.S. territories](https:\/\/www.aclu.org\/issues\/racial-justice\/anti-colonialism), were already subtracted as best as possible from the 262,083,034 voting-age population estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2023.

By no means have I come anywhere close to giving up or falling for right-wing conspiratorial to outright false talking points, but I can't stand it anymore. I watch MSNBC and the reactions are always the same. Either shock that Trump or his supporters said something, smugness over right wing hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance, or stern scolding to people who aren't watching. And then we act and treat this as a win when Trump supporters don't care. They never will because they already believe that every negative thing about him is fake, if he does do anything he said he wouldn't do it's the right choice or a ploy, and that if what he said doesn't work-out he was misled or sabotage. We act like we haven't been dealing with these people for years. Trump and his supports will never accept a loss even as they are eating the rotten discarded remains.\n\nEven when we do win it's not like they care anyways. I just saw a video about how Trump said the egg prices would go down before he even took office (because of course he is the darn tootenist gosh golly thing to touch the economy since overspeculation, buying on margin, and high variable interest rates) and while I care that eggs are still expensive, I stopped listening to Trumps boasting a long time ago. Trump supporters are still blaming Biden, and they'll continue blame him and other democrats as long as they possibly can. We act like people aren't treating us as villains for cutting out trump supporting family members and friends even though they'll pretend that their crowd has never done that. I can't be brought to care if you cut trump supporters out, by all means it might make your life better, but we act like it's only been a good thing for liberals and democrats. \n\nI talk to Trump supporters, both in my family and workplace. They haven't \"fallen besides themselves\" since Matt Gaetz withdrew, they see it as either an operation to remove democratic\/rhino opposition to Trump's next appointee or as Gaetz willingly and nobly stepping to the side so that the \"Democrat psy-op\" and \"Forged accusations\" won't distract from Trump's next term. We know that handing them the receipts won't convince them because they will have forgotten to read. When they do happen to get a win, we default to talking about our wins that they don't care about, and it just comes across as though we're living in a fantasy land. It's like we're trying to emulate them but somehow missed the point of why they behave like they do.\n\nI don't want us to give up and admit defeat.

United against the libtards and the gay agenda and the war on Christmas and against Wokeness.  Their hatred unites them like nothing units the Left.  On the Left we have different views.  We are united about gun control but we have different views on how to get that done.  We are united on saving the planet from global warming yet we have different views on how to get that done.  Police reform, abortion, public schools, unions, race relations, we are all united in the ideas yet the minutia differs.  Conservative hate though\u2026Trump says hate like this and they hate like this.  Fox News says hate like this and they hate like this.  They are united, and I honestly, have no idea how to fight that. ",

I want to know what it meant to be a democrat say 60 years ago.\n\nThere were still Americans fighting for equal rights.

Nixon got 49 states and almost double the amount of votes than McGovern. America was pure red, and yes, the republican back then was different than today\n\nBut gay people can marry who they want, it\u2019s been than way for almost 10 years.

Hell, I\u2019m sure that even when I was 6 I probably didn\u2019t know Obama was president for a long while. But I knew he was president as some point and obviously he\u2019s amazing\n\nBut 2016 rolls around and Donald Trump comes into the picture. I was rooting for Hilary, but ultimately at that point in my life, it didn\u2019t affect me that much so him winning was not a big deal. And tbh I don\u2019t even know when I started to get into politics, because I voted for Biden in 2020 but that year was such a blur that I don\u2019t even know how I felt.\n\nBut I think it must start in 2022 when the Supreme Court overturned Roe V Wade. I looked into what caused it, and found out it was trump and his justice picks. That\u2019s when it really started. I began looking briefly at some of his campaign in 2016 and just seeing the lying, pretentious, pos he really is. \n\nBut I ultimately didn\u2019t pay that much attention. I figured if Biden won once, then he could win again. But we all know how that turned out.\n\nI was so excited to see Kamala Harris running. I truly believed Trump\u2019s cult was dying out, evident by his loss in 2020, that there was no way he\u2019d win. This election would be a slam dunk and a retribution of the 2016 election. So for all 107 days of her campaign as well as every day since, I\u2019ve kept a close eye on the him, with each new rally and piece of misinformation further cementing my hatred of him and his dumbass followers\n\nThe fucking insult to injury is that he doesn\u2019t even fucking campaign. He talks about literally nothing for hours and people eat it up. In a normal world his campaign would\u2019ve ended so many times. Need I remind you that this made jacked off a microphone and pretended to suck it? Fucking hell.\n\nI\u2019ve never gotten to experience it because literally 76 million people voted for him and all of them are usually batshit crazy.\n\nBecause it seems like from an ideological standpoint no republican or democrat should ever get along? But the two party system is apparently so integral to the backbone of the country that we just have to push against each other for eternity?\n\nSo TLDR: now that I\u2019m making the effort to remain informed for probably the rest of my life, I have to know, what were republicans like in the first 15 years of the new Millennium?

        "selftext":"It seems clear to me that a subset of the ultra-wealthy may actually want American society to collapse, paving the way for a techno-autocracy where oligarchs rule. A key text influencing this ideology appears to be *The Sovereign Individual,* written in the late 1990s by William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson. The book didn\u2019t merely predict the disruptions that information technology would bring\u2014it embraced them, rooting for a future where inequality, competition, and instability would dominate.\n\nThe authors envisioned a world where governments crumble, taxes vanish, and welfare states become \u201cunfinanceable.\u201d In their harsh vision, only the \"sovereign individual\"\u2014a self-reliant, technologically adept elite\u2014would thrive. As *The Guardian* put it:\n\n[https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2018\/nov\/09\/mystic-mogg-jacob-rees-mogg-willam-predicts-brexit-plans](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2018\/nov\/09\/mystic-mogg-jacob-rees-mogg-willam-predicts-brexit-plans)\n\n&gt;\u201cBy 2010 or thereabouts, welfare states \u2018will simply become unfinanceable.\u2019 \u2026 In such a harsh world, only the most talented, self-reliant, technologically adept person \u2013 \u2018the sovereign individual\u2019 \u2013 would thrive.\u201d\n\nThe book gained little traction in late-1990s Britain, dismissed as melodramatic and out of touch with the era\u2019s optimism. But it found a warmer reception in the U.S., particularly among Silicon Valley libertarians. Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, cited *The Sovereign Individual* as one of the most influential books in his life, praising its startlingly accurate predictions about cryptocurrency, digital identities, and even bots. As Rees-Mogg and Davidson predicted:\n\n&gt;\u201c\\[A\\] \u2018new digital form of money\u2019 \\[would\\] consist of encrypted sequences \u2026 unique, anonymous and verifiable \u2026 tradable at a keystroke in a multitrillion-dollar wholesale market without borders.\u201d\n\nSound familiar? Bitcoin arrived a decade later.\n\nThiel, however, doesn\u2019t just buy into techno-libertarianism; he\u2019s also wrestled publicly with Christianity\u2019s role in shaping \"wokeness.\" In an interview reported by *Mediaite*, Thiel said:\n\n[https:\/\/www.mediaite.com\/news\/billionaire-gop-donor-peter-thiel-blames-christianity-for-wokeness-it-always-takes-the-side-of-the-victim\/](https:\/\/www.mediaite.com\/news\/billionaire-gop-donor-peter-thiel-blames-christianity-for-wokeness-it-always-takes-the-side-of-the-victim\/)\n\n&gt;\u201cChristianity ... always takes the side of the victim. \u2026 Maybe you should think of wokeness as ultra-Christianity or hyper-Christianity. It\u2019s an extreme intensification. \u2026 The past is terrible, and you can never overcome it.\u201d\n\nThiel seems to see \"wokeness\" as a kind of mutated Christianity\u2014focused on sin, victimhood, and moral judgment without forgiveness.\n\nThis leaves us in a precarious spot. Christian nationalism, with its regressive social agenda, is troubling enough. But a future shaped by social Darwinists like Thiel\u2014who see safety nets and compassion as obstacles\u2014could be even darker. Right now, both forces seem to be jockeying for influence over \u201cWeekend at Trumpy\u2019s,\u201d with the likes of Elon Musk and Thiel cozying up to Trump in ways Christian Nationalists can only dream of.\n\nWhichever side wins the most influence, the rest of us stand to lose.\n\nChristian nationalism is a plague, but if social darwinists take control, things will get truly dark IMO. They want the destruction of any and all social safety nets.\n\nThe difference is that rightwing Christians want the Church to provide the safety net, not the government. The government is perceived as a threat to their power and ability to provide that, even if churches only provide a minimal safety net on their terms, and are often designed in ways to enhance their authority and can be exploitive.\n\nWhereas social darwinists literally don't want social safety nets at all... they want survival of the fittest.",

        "title":"AI's Solution to the 2024\/2028 Election",
        "selftext":"Like most of you, I am just about DONE with MAGA and the GOP and our gullible citizens.  I am at a loss for how to counter their strategy of constant lying, so I went to AI for help.  I think its response has some interesting strategies, so I am copying it here.  Sorry if this breaks some sub rule.\n\nHere's my question: \"So, recently Donald Trump (the Republican Candidate) won the 2024 election over Kamala Harris (the Democratic Candidate).  From what I can tell he mostly won by spouting an impossible number of lies that were effectively unchallengable because of the sheer number of them.  This allowed his followers to pick and choose which things they wanted to believe about him, while his opponent had to pick a few stances and then either stick with them or be chastised for them.  Use your logical, mathematical mind to determine how Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could successfully counter this strategy.\"\n\nThe response: \n\"Countering a strategy built on an overwhelming volume of misinformation and narrative control requires a structured, multi-layered approach that addresses both the dynamics of truth and human psychology. Here\u2019s a logical breakdown of what Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could do:\n1. Prioritize Narrative Simplicity and Consistency\n\n    The Problem: An avalanche of lies is overwhelming because it exploits the cognitive bias of simplicity. Lies that resonate with existing biases are easier for people to remember.\n    The Solution:\n        Develop 3\u20135 core themes that resonate emotionally and are easily repeatable (e.g., \"Working for Every American\").\n        Use repetition to create cognitive stickiness. Every appearance, speech, and media opportunity should circle back to these core themes.\n        Frame responses to attacks within this narrative. For example, \"That's another distraction; we're focused on [core theme].\"\n\n2. Use Selective Fact-Checking Strategically\n\n    The Problem: Countering every lie can lead to fatigue or the \"illusory truth effect,\" where repetition makes lies seem true.\n    The Solution:\n        Choose to debunk high-impact lies that can cause measurable harm or derail the core message.\n        Use a \"truth sandwich\" approach: Start with the truth, briefly debunk the lie, and return to the truth.\n        Collaborate with trusted media and fact-checking platforms to preemptively debunk repeated falsehoods.\n\n3. Humanize the Campaign\n\n    The Problem: Broadly targeted lies thrive because they lack specific emotional grounding.\n    The Solution:\n        Focus on individual stories and human connections. Highlight real people and how policies affect them directly.\n        Deploy surrogates (trusted community voices, not just politicians) to amplify these stories and refute misinformation within their circles.\n\n4. Leverage Data and Analytics\n\n    The Problem: Lies spread because they are emotionally engaging, often through targeted digital campaigns.\n    The Solution:\n        Employ micro-targeted ads to reach key demographics with messages tailored to counter misinformation in their specific contexts.\n        Monitor misinformation trends using AI and analytics tools to identify and counter viral narratives quickly.\n\n5. Strengthen Institutional Trust\n\n    The Problem: Lies undermine trust in institutions, making it easier for false narratives to thrive.\n    The Solution:\n        Position the campaign as a force for institutional renewal and reform. Avoid defensiveness; instead, advocate for transparency and accountability.\n        Partner with trusted non-political organizations to communicate key messages.\n\n6. Call Out the \"Flood of Lies\"\n\n    The Problem: People may not notice the volume and strategy behind misinformation unless it is explicitly pointed out.\n    The Solution:\n        Introduce the concept of \"lie overload\" into public discourse. Use humor or metaphors (e.g., \"trying to drink truth from a firehose of lies\").\n        Highlight patterns of dishonesty rather than individual claims, framing them as disrespectful to voters.\n\n7. Emphasize Unity and Forward-Looking Optimism\n\n    The Problem: Lies can create polarization and fear, which motivates voters to cling to familiar narratives.\n    The Solution:\n        Offer a vision that is positive, inclusive, and solution-oriented.\n        Use optimistic messaging to contrast with the chaos and divisiveness sown by misinformation.\n\n8. Pre-Bunk Before Debunk\n\n    The Problem: Lies often take hold because they meet people unprepared.\n    The Solution:\n        Anticipate likely misinformation themes and preemptively address them with facts and framing before they gain traction.\n        For example, before a false claim about taxes emerges, emphasize, \"We're ensuring tax fairness for working families while billionaires pay their share.\"\n\nBy sticking to these strategies, a Democratic candidate can navigate the challenges of a misinformation-heavy campaign while maintaining integrity and effectiveness. Ultimately, the goal is to frame the campaign as an advocate for the truth and solutions, rather than just reacting to falsehoods.\"",

        "selftext":"Dozens of studies have been done on the difference between liberal and conservative brains with MRI imaging all over the world - and the word they've coined for it is: \"Neural Partisanship\". Multiple research studies show that Conservatives have a slightly larger amygdala - the brain\u2019s emotion and fear processing center. The difference is small - but has large impact on how Conservatives see the world. This slight enlargement makes Conservatives more reactive to what they perceive as \"threats\". (This is not to say there are not other factors, life experiences, that influence them. But neurobiology provides a framework about our predisposition to certain positions.\n\nThe amygdala is also responsible for gearing \"flight\/fight\" responses under the influence of the cortisol produced by the adrenal glands. Most of these studies were done by linking participants to MRI machines and observing their neural reactions. Some researchers got so good at interpreting the data that they could tell if a person leaned Liberal or Conservative just by observing how neural pathways lit up during the session. \n\nThe amygdala acts like the brain\u2019s alarm system for everyone. When it detects a threat, it springs into action, triggering our fight-or-flight response. In the context of anger, the amygdala is often the first to sound the alarm, setting off a cascade of emotional and physiological responses.  Change is often perceived as a threat and is a stressor for many people, but for Conservatives it's something to which they are very sensitive. Their response to a perceived threat will typically be greater than a Liberal brain. \n\n**Cue the media.** \n\nConservatives don't typically leave their news \"bubble\" - they watch Fox, OAN, NewMax, and others. who feed them fear-mongering news in a continuous stream which often generates fear and anxiety. (They don't call it \"rage media\" for nothing.) Being fed \"threats\" - to themselves, their families and their country -  24\/7 leads to high cortisol production 24\/7. Essentially, all this means  is that their brains are marinated in fear, anxiety and that they will often respond to threats with anger, rather than a reasoned consideration of the issue.\n\n**\\[On a personal note, it is absolutely amazing how triggered Conservatives get when you give them this information. I was called a \"moron\" and \"bitch\" by one man who then went on to quote Scripture talking about how Jesus approved of \"war\". I was invited to \"go outside and have my face punched in\" -  just in the last few days...so  - apparently even having a discussion about the source of their political orientation produces a rage reaction in them. Seriously over the top anger...\\]**\n\nThe following are additional notes from the studies in no particular order - and they explain so much when we look at the predispositions of Conservatives and Liberals.\n\n\"One interesting study found that, compared to liberals, conservatives show a \"larger volume of gray matter in the right amygdala (rAMG), a region that plays a critical role in the processing of negative, aversive human emotions like sadness, fear, and threat, and less gray matter in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a region linked to error monitoring, belief updating, and affect-regulation.\u201d\n\n\"Liberals and conservatives differ in their neural interpretations of political concepts.\"\n\n\"Conservatives are worse at distinguishing truths and falsehoods than liberals.\"\n\n\"Conservatives have greater psychological resilience attributable to greater impulse control and causal reasoning.\"\n\n\"Conservatives, compared to liberals, see scientific and non-scientific viewpoints as closer in legitimacy.\" (Note: In other words, if your medical doctors tells you one thing about your medical condition, and the guy you're sitting next to in the casino tells you something different...Conservatives are more likely to give them both the same weight. Anyone remember COVID?)\n\n\"Liberals show greater cognitive flexibility than conservatives, meaning they have a greater ability to appropriately and efficiently adjust their behavior according to a changing environment.\u201c\n\n\"In moral judgments, conservatives emphasize value of actions, while liberals emphasize value of expected outcome.\"\n\n\"Liberals solve problems more via insight than step-by-step analysis.\"\n\n\"Conservatives give more weight to negative information than positive information, compared with liberals.\"\n\n\"Individual political attitudes correlate with physiological traits, such as sensitivity to sudden noises and threatening visual images.\"\n\n\"When faced with a conflict, liberals are more likely than conservatives to alter their habitual response when cues indicate it is necessary.\"\n\n\"Liberals focus on the future more than the past, while conservatives focus on the past more than the future.\"\n\n\"Conservatives and liberals react similarly to positive incentives, but conservatives have greater sensitivity to negative stimuli.\"\n\n\"Reliance on quick, efficient, and \u201clow effort\u201d thought processes yields conservative ideologies, while effortful and deliberate reasoning yields liberal ideologies.\"\n\n**What does this mean for the future?**\n\nWell, we need to acknowledge that they don't have a lot of control over their biological fear\/anxiety responses. But they are still responsible for their language and behavior. They are riding high right now - but it is incredibly difficult to have a discussion with someone who is kept in a heightened state of fear and rage - and who can't break their addiction to right-wing media. \n\nI wish I had more answers, but for now, if we can just understand some of their physiological responses and understanding how their brains react - it will be a step in the right direction. Stop trying to reason, argue, discuss, point out harm, economic disaster, etc. They don't even hear it. They just perceive those as \"Liberal threats\", become angry and you will have accomplished nothing except raising your own blood pressure.\n\n\\+++++++++++++\n\nAll of these discussions and citations to the individual study can be found here -  \n  \n[https:\/\/amarkfoundation.org\/reports\/how-are-the-brains-of-liberals-and-conservatives-different-update\/](https:\/\/amarkfoundation.org\/reports\/how-are-the-brains-of-liberals-and-conservatives-different-update\/)\n\n",

        "selftext":"Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter was a corporate melodrama of hubris and miscalculation. Forced into the $44 billion deal after an ill-fated public declaration of interest\u2014and a subsequent legal entanglement\u2014Musk found himself trapped. The deal drained a substantial portion of his wealth, publicly tethered him to a troubled platform, and bruised his reputation. Tesla, the crown jewel of his empire, saw its stock dip as investors questioned his judgment and priorities. To many, the world's richest man now seemed outmaneuvered, exposed, and mocked on the very platform he now owned.\n\nBut Musk, a man who thrives on reinvention, channeled his humiliation into calculated revenge\u2014not just against those who mocked him, but against the entire system he saw as flawed and hypocritical. If the acquisition of Twitter had turned him into a global punchline, he would reshape the punchline into a weapon.\n\nOver time, the platform transformed under his guidance\u2014chaotic, polarizing, and riddled with policy decisions that seemed less about business strategy and more about dismantling cultural norms. Musk's motivations became inscrutable, but one pattern emerged: he sought to amplify voices that promised upheaval, regardless of their political orientation. He reconnected with figures like Donald Trump, whose populist appeal and chaotic energy mirrored Musk\u2019s own ethos of disruption.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t ideological. Musk didn\u2019t care about partisan divides; he cared about breaking the status quo. America had humiliated him, and now he would humiliate America. In funding Trump\u2019s political resurgence, Musk wasn\u2019t endorsing a candidate\u2014he was creating a spectacle. His millions flowed into the campaign not to champion a cause but to watch the world\u2019s most powerful democracy devour itself.\n\nKamala Harris wasn\u2019t defeated by Donald Trump. She was outmaneuvered by Elon Musk\u2019s shadowy influence. Musk\u2019s resources, his platform, and his vendetta shaped the electoral landscape. The election wasn\u2019t just a contest of ideologies; it was a stage for Musk\u2019s experiment in chaos.\n\nAs the dust settled, Musk stood apart, watching a world he had pushed toward the brink. Was it revenge, sociopathy, or the perverse thrill of proving that even the most powerful systems could be puppets to his whims? Musk\u2019s actions defied easy categorization, but the consequences were clear: he wasn\u2019t just a tech mogul anymore. He had become something else entirely\u2014a kingmaker, a chaos agent, a man whose wounds fueled his quest to reshape the world in his image.\n\nAnd for those who had once mocked him, that was the cruelest irony of all.",

I asked for advice in another thread and ended up getting a lot of \"put family above politics\" type responses which I found to be completely unhelpful. To anyone else having the same issues in their family, I found a good resource from SPLC. I've decided that I will have a zero tolerance policy in my home for racism (casual or overt), homophobic, transphobic, anti-immigrant, misogynistic comments, etc. If I hear it in my home, I will call it out and politely ask them to leave. And if I hear it in their homes, I will tell them I'm uncomfortable with those kind of comments and politely leave. I don't care if they're family... We vote our values and believe their ideology is dangerous. At best, they're putting their party over the safety and health of the most vulnerable in society. At worst, they're actively encourating policies that are going to hurt a lot of people. They aren't just \"opinions\" - these policies have real life consequences.

However, that journey has brought me to a place where I\u2019m increasingly infuriated that the Dems don\u2019t seem to fully understand their enemy, nor have they demonstrated the grit needed in a moment like this.\n\nI truly believe we are at a critical moment where the coming months could decide our fate for the rest of our lives. That fat orange fuck has vowed to reshape our country into something none of us would recognize. AND YET- Kamala conceded with barely a peep (despite some actual concerning anomalies imo), Biden is teeheeing with tangerine Hitler in the Oval Office, Warren is TWEETING about how Ol\u2019 Donny Boy broke the law again (he\u2019s a felon??? That\u2019s what criminals do??? HELLO??) and NO ONE seems to be calling for the type of drastic action or leadership that is needed right now.

And I\u2019m dead fucking serious when I say we actually need a blue MAGA movement. A blue tea party movement. Activists and candidates who are populist, loud, and willing to throw every fucking dirty trick the Republicans have done over the last decade *right back in their faces.* \n\nI\u2019m talking candidates who insult their opponents and attack establishment Dems on a level not yet seen before. Activists who go to elected official offices with the pure intent of creating click bait content to feed our base. Podcasters who make that little Shitler Nick Fuentes and that bald idiot Rogan look tame. A multi prong, ruthless approach, with the end goal of making the Dems cower like the MAGA fuckers cucked the Republicans. And none of this fucking infighting- everyone falls in line. Everyone supports the movement. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re fair game too. \n\nOur country, *our home* is in danger. We need to organize and act accordingly. We need to be as ruthless and dirty and cutthroat as the Republicans have been for years. Fuck your moral high ground. Fuck your norms. If you don\u2019t have the stomach for war, then get the fuck out of our way. Is anyone else with me? \n\n",

        "selftext":"Some quick thoughts on what I think needs changing:\n\n* Dems need to focus on concrete solutions, and abandon all of the feelings and vibes nonsense.  I could hear it in almost every speech the last 4 years.  Dripping with feelings and warm fuzzies. Just stop.  Propose long-term solutions, or don't even try.  The vast majority of Americans want problem solving, not an emotional bath.  \"A, B, and C are problems, and we think X, Y, and Z will address at least some of it, and here's how, and here's how it gets paid for.\"\n* DEAL WITH THE BORDER.  I used to think the greatest unforced political error in history was Romney's \"my message is for you, not the 47% of Americans that don't pay taxes.\"  Not anymore.  Escorting millions of border crossers into red border states - who then bussed them to blue cities and suburbs -  is now the greatest unforced political error that the free world will ever see.\n* Stop marching dudes with mustaches, red lipstick, and dresses in front of voters. I believe most folks don't care what the individual does with their own time, but for the love of god, don't alienate voters like you did.  That was another unforced political error.\n* Never again make the mistake of pigeon-holing the other candidate as a nazi or a felon, without proving to voters beyond a shadow of a doubt that your vision of governance (taxation, foreign policy, economic growth measures, etc) is better than theirs.\n* Never again run for president and tell voters that you want to raise taxes.  Even if it's only on high earners.  High earners have kids, parents, siblings, friends, and neighbors who all vote also.  If a reporter ever asks a future dem candidate about their position on taxes, the answer should be \"we feel strongly that we need to get the nose of the national debt pointed back into a safer trajectory. We have a list of investments in infrastructure that need to be addressed, but nothing - no bridges, no roads, no dams, no power lines - is going to be replaced if republicans keep eroding the tax base and driving us ever deeper in debt. We're on a bad trajectory, and both sides got us there.\"\n* Don't ever - ever, ever, ever, ever - ignore inflation again.   ",

You poor things. Ya know, the truth may not be as loud, it may get silenced, or get lost in the sauce, but its always out there. You can only cover your tracks so much before things just start coming up. The rich aren't here to save us. Never have been never will be. A job isn't a job anymore when the boss is your government. One person loses their freedoms the rest follows. History has told us this time and time again. Cutting off trade with tariffs and reinforcing immigration will not help a country that depends on trade for survival, but it will cut us off and distance us from the world more. A liberal media purge which you all assume is fake news, or biased against your beliefs, whatever, means you get one sided, biased, misinformation 24\/7. There are no checks and balances on media coverage, meaning we get a constant flood of Trumps message. What he wants us to believe. Hes already done it, who are we even kidding, most of you are so delusional and detatched from reality, this is a waste of time even explaining it, while you think that is the \"right thing for America, make America Great again\" there was never anything wrong with America before Trump. People may have had different views but division and conflict hadn't occurred on this level over American politics GLOBALLY until he was a candidate. People played dirty but they didn't play this dirty. Things that have happened over his candidacy, if you would have asked me a decade ago if anything like what hes done or said sounds like an American President, I would say no. Anyone who is old enough, sane enough, smart enough would agree. Like dude Bush was cooler than this. Republicans were different then, had more integrity. Now, as for him helping the economy, bandaid solutions to gaping wound problems. To fix the economy you have to have people who are clean off drugs, people who are EDUCATED, people who are secure, have homes, access to information and resources, this creates job growth, personal growth, and ensures the happiness and growth of your citizens. Businesses with government regulation, have limits on what they can charge, because businesses unregulated can charge whatever, claim whatever, and get off scot free with minimal consequence. What's that mean? Say you order a defibrillator for emergencies and you have a heart condition and it doesn't work, the company that sold it to you isn't liable for faulty products. Pay up. Does anyone remember company stores? Coal camps? Where businesses owned the town, made the cost of living, made the cost of goods? Miserable. Pay up. Our abundance of year round produce like bananas, pineapples, ect. ect. Tariffs. Trade bans. I know you hate admitting you are wrong, I know it goes against your \"God\" or how you were \"raised\" but take away your religion, take away your political views, you are just hateful, ignorant, narcissistic, detatched, facetious, insecure, delusional, sad and angry little person. Maybe not all of those things, but many combinations of the list, yes. You chose to forsake others for money you won't get to touch, promises that won't be kept, and it will catch up with you. You've chosen ignorance when the Earth is at a pivotal point of deciding to open the mind or stay in the past thinking the past is a path for the future. Thats absolutely insane. And this is just for you Reddit Conservative Republican Christians who keep coming over here with your stupid show your small dick mentality. Now as for the rest of your votes that win you the election? Fake fascist commie Fox news. Voter fraud. We demand a recount. We won the election before it happened. Russia interfered in the election. He cheated. Hes senile. Hes a risk to national security. Tired Trump. He flooded the media both Conservative and Liberal for 12 years I call fraud on account of Stockholm Syndrome and misinformation based fraud combined with the effects of repetition frequency on the illusory truth effect. Hes already held you captive for 12 years. People just want you poor saps to wake up before you drink the freaking Kool-aid because they care about you. They fact check you because they care about you. They don't want you WOKE they just want you to OPEN YOUR FUCKING EYES. *mic drop* And don't expect a reply.",

That's what he had last time back in 2020. His base has not changed. Going on Joe Rogan didn't change, which, by the way, just want to say I called out Joe Rogan for being a conservative shill a long time ago. \n\nBut I digress. Where are these extra votes going to come from? Harris still sits firmly 4 million votes behind Trump. Eat me. No way she catches up. Those 15 million other votes just stayed home. \n\nAnd I agree with the fact that they stayed home because she was a woman. Had she been a man she'd have won this election.\n\nMisogyny is ingrained in America. THAT is why she lost. It's not because she wasn't qualified or what have you. It's because she's a woman.\n\nShe was younger, smarter, quicker, and agile... yet she lost to a senile old man who takes a crap anytime someone says something bad about him.\n\nYou will never convince me it WASN'T because she was a woman.\n\nI say that as a white, atheist, bi man living in Idaho by the way. So if you want to question my motives for saying this. Go for it.\n\nEdit: I see there are comments here pointing out the racism and yes, I agree, America is racist as shit. But Obama got elected.

A concentrated, well-funded, scorched-earth campaign of lies that has been carried out from the ground up by Republican leadership.\n\nIt starts with Fox News, built up over decades to be a machine that spews out hate-filled lies 24\/7 into the ears of the public. It continues with the media ecosystem of small publications, podcasters, and media personalities that echo the Fox News talking points and take it even further, waging the front lines of the culture war out of personal passion, not realizing--or not caring--they're the acting as the gullible patsies of the oligarchs who fund it all. And it is capped, in these years, by Trump himself, the most shameless liar to ever sully the stage of American politics with his presence. Trump, who cannot open his mouth without lying, who has managed to break every record for the number of lies spoken in a single speech, who built his popularity on the back of one Big Lie after another--without hesitating either to intersperse them with a thousand small lies.\n\nIt is tempting of course to look at our own leaders and our own policies and try to ask, \"what did we do wrong? What policy could we present differently to appeal to (*insert demographic here*)?\" But this is misguided, because how would any policy hold any appeal if they never know what it is?\n\nIt's tempting to look at the facts and the way our leaders spoke about them and say, \"She should have hit this fact harder, driven home this point more clearly!\" But what purpose does that ever serve if they don't know what the facts are?\n\nSimilarly, it is tempting to take refuge in the misery-laden moan of, \"Oh, this country is more racists\/bigoted\/misogynist than I thought it was!\" Certainly Trump actively courts the racist and misogynist vote, but if that were the beginning and end of the story then why did so many minorities and women vote for him? When you ask the rank-and-file voters--not the hardcore bigots--why they voted the way they did, it has to do with economy, policy, the border, and their own wellfare... all hard-and-fast, real-world factors.\n\nFactors they are wrong about. Because of a deliberate campaign of lies.\n\nWe'll never be able to move toward a sane government as long as lies reign unchecked across our society. How can you make good decisions if you don't know the truth? And Trump supporters don't need to be unusually ignorant or naive to believe the lies when they're coming from every direction. When you hear the same thing on your preferred big cable TV news program, and from your favorite podcaster, and from your candidate for President (all people who you *should* be able to trust!) you'd have to be crazy to question it!\n\nMy theory is a cabal of wealthy oligarchs funded and built this media environment in order to promote policies good for themselves--low taxes on the rich and low regulation on business. In so doing, they have betrayed the trust of the millions of people who look to media for trustworthy information.\n\nAnd we are never going to move forward as a country (liberal or otherwise!) unless we can undermine this campaign of lies and somehow move back to a shared sense of facts--and ones that are actually based in fact!\n\nSo stop blaming bigotry or Harris or Trump voters. Blame the oligarchs who've built this engine of lies for their own benefit.\n\nAnd ask the real question, the only one likely to help: what do we do about it?",

Words must mean something and theirs mean nothing. \n\nA liberal is someone who wants change against what has been. Yes, there are other definitions, but we are gonna be merriam-Webster about this. \n\nNow the idea that republicans can\u2019t be liberal, isn\u2019t true. Lincoln was a liberal republican. That\u2019s important as the demonization of republicans will most certainly lead into not prying away their base. And prying away is just as important as creating a new movement and trying to get people to follow. \n\nBut we don\u2019t need to create a new movement. There already exist one that is quite liberal. We borrow it. But we don\u2019t return it. \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nThe current state of the world is that the very wealthy literally own everything. Even Republicans acknowledge this but they can\u2019t put their finger on it (talking about voters not the elites who I\u2019m speaking of anyways). Doesn\u2019t matter what country you go to either. Left or right, they own it. \n\nEven progressive voices acknowledge this. But they  put their focus on more than one topic and then the message becomes lost. \n\n\u2014\u2014\nWhy is that important? \n\nRepublicans tend to be single issue voters. Dems tend to focus on multiple things but then will hardline towards single issues at the end. So the single issue that has overlap is \u2026.classism. \n\nAnd the solution to classism most certainly covers almost all topics and demographics. They have, you don\u2019t. \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nThe pivot must stress classism. You don\u2019t always have to detail it so eloquently as if you were a philosopher being quoted some hundreds of years from now. I wouldn\u2019t do that, as you\u2019ll lose focus of the uneducated. \n\nConservative absolutely protect that classist ideology. But don\u2019t attack conservatives themselves, just the belief in \u201ctheir billionaires.\u201d \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nNext, we must sooner rather than later, pick someone to lead this. The way we do that is by highlighting them and sharing them everywhere (obviously). We all must brainstorm who that is. But it cannot be Sanders because of age. Ideally, it\u2019s someone middle aged. That gets young and old on board. 60 is not middle aged. Somewhere around 40 is. \n\nThis person must not be elite or come from elites. It must be grassroots. You cannot have them accept from the rich. They must abstain. They essentially cannot be worth millions. \n\n\u2014\u2014 \n\nIf you did not read and only scrolled towards the end, the problem is that liberals (who want to change things) aren\u2019t focusing on the main issue of the fact that the elites of owned things since our country\u2019s birth. That needs to change and we must pivot to stress it. \n\nProgressives need to understand that a lot of the issues involving civil liberties can change due to solving this issue, and conservatives don\u2019t actually make up much of the country. The parties do. Most people believe in change. \n\nEconomic issues play one of the largest if not the largest, historically and most likely always will. \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit: but also brainstorm. Don\u2019t just take it from me. But do understand that classism is going to play the biggest role. ",

        "selftext":"I suggest we should look at this election loss from a perspective of vote-splitting. It's not the only valid perspective, but there are lessons here.\n\nWe can approximate the country into four quadrants divided along two axes: pro-life\/pro-choice, pro-democracy\/anti-democracy. The pro-choice\/pro-democracy party is the institutional Democratic Party. The pro-life\/pro-democracy people explicitly aren't allowed in that club, because the Party refuses to (as they would put it) compromise on women's rights, and the pro-life crowd won't compromise on the issue either. The anti-democracy people are the institutional Republican Party, and were able to work together better regardless of their pro-life\/pro-choice stance. So now we have effectively three parties, in a system built for two, and vote-splitting screws the entire pro-democracy camp.\n\nThe correct solution is for the Democratic Party to compromise on the pro-life\/pro-choice axis, on an *explicitly temporary* basis. Allow pro-life candidates back into the party, on the condition that once the Democratic Party gains power in any state or at a federal level, it should immediately begin a defined program of massive systematic reform, which includes reforms that make the system function with more than two parties. (No more first-past-the-post, approval voting FTW, among other solutions.) After that, the pro-life and pro-choice wings can safely part ways, but still opportunistically cooperate, without handing the entire government over to the fascists.\n\nThe GOP became the party of Trump due to vote-splitting; he won the 2016 primary with only 40% of the votes cast. The GOP didn't fix the problem, they doubled down. Can the Democrats instead learn the lesson that the fundamental problem is our election systems, and until that gets fixed, nothing else will?",

The NYT came out with that one poll that people said was terrible, and should be completely ignored, because it oversampled conservative voters, which completely missed the point of what the poll was trying to accomplish.\n\n## Election Day\nAs soon as the Florida results came in and showed an unexpected hard shift to the right, I felt things looked bad. I commented that it could be a bad portent of what was to come. People were completely ignoring massive shifts in results (like Miami-Dade). But people scoffed and literally said I was dooming. On the NYT map, even before the swing states really started reporting in larger numbers, you could see the mass of red arrows indicating shifts to the right across the board. But nope, doesn't mean much because the swing states could still be different. People kept repeating that it was just like the 2020 red mirage, but completely ignored how the red mirage in that election happened in the first place (and why it wasn't happening again this election).\n\n## Voters\nPeople frequently posted questions (and are still doing it) about \"How do people *still* vote for Trump\". I think this is probably one of the major points that people just do not seem to get. Yes, Trump has a (relatively) small core of hard-core supporters. They know what he says, what his policies are and will do, and embrace it all because they want exactly that. But the vast majority of people vote for him because they have no exposure to politics. They don't know what Trump says, his policies, his actions, etc. And it's very difficult to get through to those people. How do you break through to people who ignore politics? It's a catch-22 situation. Because of this, they do not understand the rhetoric of him being an authoritarian or why his policies will be harmful.\n\nAnd this is where the left's, particularly on Reddit, messaging completely breaks down and becomes harmful. Because these people don't understand the reasons, calling them fascists or bigots has no context. They are being labeled as something for reasons that are completely unknown to them. It gives them no incentive to vote for your candidate, or vote at all, when they see one side attacking them (or what is viewed as attacking).\n\nWhat they do know is that Trump has told them he will bring about a change that will improve the aspects of their lives that are important to them. The policies are irrelevant. The actions are irrelevant. They want change.\n\nWhich brings me back to the first line:\n\n## **CHANGE** We can believe in\n\nThis was the campaign slogan for Obama in 2008. It's a brilliant slogan because it's exactly what point want: Change. The specifics don't matter. \"Change\" means different things for different people and people want change that will improve their lives. Trump's campaign pushed change. He told people what they wanted to hear, and they rewarded him for it.\n\nAnd it's also why Harris' slogan was a fucking disaster: \"We're not going back\". This is *exactly* what people want though. They want to go back to before inflation and before things cost so much. They want to go back to when people didn't call them fascists. It doesn't matter the reasons for those things happening now. What matters is what the people want. Sure, she tried to address those things, by pointing out what Biden has passed that helped the economy and protections for various civil rights. But it's a horrible campaign strategy. People do not view the economy and their own personal expenses as the same thing. Ask people how the CHIPS Act or how the BBB Act has improved their lives, you wont get an answer. So telling them that those things did is useless. And Harris ever saying that she'll continue Biden's work or do the same things was incredibly stupid. You don't tell people who are demanding change (whatever that \"change\" may be) that you're not going to change. Of course they wont vote for you then.\n\nReddit is not reality. Neither is Twitter\/X, Facebook, or any other social media. No doubt they're all bubbles in their own right. But if liberals really want to encourage voters to support them, they need to stop labeling people regardless of whether it's right or wrong or true or not: It simply does not work. The last 3 elections are proof of that.\n\nRedditors need to break out of the bubble that exists here. Polling for the past 10 months gave indication that Democrats were going to have trouble, and yet were shocked when that's exactly what happened. Ignoring that did not change reality. Ignoring that people were frustrated with the state of things did not change reality. People were going to vote for Trump because of it and simply labeling them with negative titles to try and guilt them to vote for Harris accomplished nothing.\n\nPart of the problem is where people interact with others too. On Reddit, it's a lot of polar opposites: hard left with hard right. So of course it gets a bit contentious. But out in the real world it's different. If you want Average Joe to see your side, acknowledge that shit can suck right now. Both you and him probably wish groceries were cheaper. Your ideas on how to fix it likely differ, but you have to start somewhere. And just discarding him and calling him a fascist for supporting the guy who *claims* that he'll improve Joe's life sure isn't going to make Joe want to do anything you suggest to him.\n\nFixing the problems, I know, goes well beyond just getting out of the bubble. But it's a start to understanding that simply moving forward with the same mentality isn't going to suddenly work.",

        "selftext":"After the 2016 election I was, like most liberals, at a complete loss as to what happened and felt like I lacked any understanding of the American electorate. I was incredibly disappointed in my fellow Americans. I still am. But we\u2019ve had *eight years* to figure them out how to persuade them to vote this infantile sociopath out of public life. We failed miserably at doing the *things that are under control* to win. I\u2019m so sick of hearing about the things that are *not* under our control, like inflation, the economy, the right wing media, and the intelligence\/ignorance\/gullibility of the electorate. For the love of god can we focus on  **addressing the concerns of the American electorate* as they are, not as we want them to be, instead of constantly trying to deflect or explain them away. Even worse is chastising people for having concerns. There are always going to be external factors that influence elections. Tough sh*t. \n\nThe American electorate is **economically populist and socially moderate**. For the social progressives here, you don\u2019t have to like it but you do have to accept reality. We need a **simple and positive message that matches the will of the American electorate**. \n\nExamples:\n\n1. Immigration. \n\n\u201cWe love legal immigration. It\u2019s been the backbone of our country forever. We want a fair system where people can legally emigrate. However we will not tolerate lawlessness and will strictly enforce our borders. I wish we would have addressed this earlier but we are serious now. And by the way, we have a great bill that Republicans failed to pass.\u201d \n\n2. Inflation. \n\nYes: \u201cI know the American people are hurting. The problem is wages have not kept up with inflation. [insert populist message]\n\nNo: \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, it\u2019s slowed down to normal now!\u201d  \n\n3. Social issues. \n\nYes: \u201cYeah, some of us got a little out of hand during the pandemic era, but the Democratic Party categorically rejects the lawlessness of the defund the police movement and rejects government overreach in imposing social values on others. We reject identity politics and are here for everyone!\u201d\n\nNo: \u201cUhh, next question.\u201d \n\n4. Media\/social media. \n\nYes: \u201cWe categorically reject government censorship of social media, outside of state secrets and other serious stuff like that. We are not your big brother. We believe in freedom. Yes I\u2019ll absolutely go on Joe Rogan and even light up a joint!\u201d \n\nNo: \u201canother GOP talking point - I can\u2019t believe you idiots are falling for it! Rogan!? Sounds risky!\u201d.\n\n5. Freedom. \n\n\u201cWe are the party of freedom! Let\u2019s legalize weed! Also online gambling! We will protect your porn! And obviously, a woman\u2019s right to choose! The GOP will do none of this. *They* want to be your big brother, not us.\u201d \n\n6. Trump. \n\nYes: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give a shi*t about you. He cares about golfing and doesn\u2019t even like to read.\u201d \n\nNo: \u201cHe\u2019s a fascist\/racist!\u201d \n\nThe bottom line is we have to address issues as they are brought up - *even if they are brought up in bad faith* by the GOP. Deflecting and pointing out they are being brought up to manipulate and don\u2019t really matter to many people\u2019s lives - *even if true* - is an absolutely awful strategy that has played a large role in leading to this disaster. We are not being manipulated into *responding* to culture war and other issues, we are being manipulated into *not responding* and taking an actual stance on these issues because the GOP knows it looks bad when we do it. It\u2019s not that hard folks: if something seems to matter to people, address it head on with an economically populist and socially moderate standpoint. Do not deflect and externalize blame. End rant. \n\nNow let\u2019s go! ",

It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed when so much is on the line, but let\u2019s take a moment to step back and remember a few things.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ve already moved the needle in so many ways. No matter what happens tonight, we\u2019ve seen progress over the last few years that didn\u2019t just happen by chance. It happened because people fought for it, showed up, and stayed engaged. Change is slow, frustratingly so sometimes, but every cycle we\u2019re part of it. Voting is one step\u2014what we\u2019re building goes beyond today.\n\nSecond, don\u2019t underestimate the power of a long game. The path to lasting change has always been two steps forward, one step back. Look at history\u2014most of the progress we\u2019ve made came from people who kept showing up, even after tough losses. Our voices aren\u2019t going anywhere after tonight. If we want a future that reflects our values, our support for progressive causes, candidates, and policies will continue regardless of the outcome.\n\nFinally, remember that we\u2019re in this together. The most meaningful changes come from people like us working at every level\u2014in our communities, local elections, and, yes, even in the halls of Congress. It\u2019s not about one candidate or one election; it\u2019s about building a movement that stays strong beyond election cycles.\n\nSo let\u2019s hang in there today, support each other, and keep showing up for the values we believe in. Whatever happens tonight, we\u2019ll regroup, we\u2019ll keep fighting, and we\u2019ll keep moving forward.",

I was at his house doing some repairs on his banister, which wasn\u2019t holding up to the rigors of 3 children in the house.  We started talking politics.  Something we typically avoid in my  family. \n\nI told him how I was planning on voting 3rd party for that presidential election.  I was standing on my high horse proclaiming my protest vote, and complaining about how much I hated my options.  That \u201cpoliticians needed to do better if they wanted to win my vote\u201d. \n\nThat\u2019s when he said something to me, turning that day into a core memory.  \u201cI typically vote for whoever is going to get me closer to the finish line\u201d.  \n\nWhy was this so profound to me?  It feels like it should have been obvious.\n\nHOW often do we hear people talk about choosing the \"lesser evil.\" It\u2019s a phrase that weighs heavily on all of us, making it feel like we\u2019re stuck between two unappealing options. I get it\u2014it\u2019s frustrating and disheartening to feel like you\u2019re settling for someone who doesn\u2019t fully represent your values. But I want to share a different perspective with you: instead of looking at it as picking the lesser of two evils, think of it as voting for the person who can help us get closer to where we want to be.\n\nThis has completely changed the way I vote, and the way I feel about voting.  This little change in my thought process has helped me realize that there is no quick way to the finish line.  We aren\u2019t going to travel miles into progress over night.  The fight for freedom and equality is a game of inches. Another way to think about it is climbing up a ladder is a lot slower than falling off a ladder.\n\nI fully believe the phrase \u201cVoting for the lesser evil\u201d is a term coined by bad actors. The number of times it\u2019s been pushed on us through social media is not by accident.  It\u2019s designed to make you feel regret, and resignation.  You don\u2019t have to feel this way. Casting your vote for the candidate that keeps you closer to your goals is a noble thing, and you should be proud of it. Often times you will find when you vote this way your goals come into view faster than you expect.\n\nWhen I think about my vote in this way, I get a sense of empowerment. I\u2019m not just a passive participant in a flawed system; I\u2019m part of a movement. It encourages me not just to vote but to get involved in my community, to advocate for the policies I believe in, and to engage in conversations that matter. My vote is just one piece of a larger puzzle, and I want to help fit those pieces together.\n\nSo, the next time you\u2019re preparing to vote, or if you haven\u2019t yet voted in this election; remember this: you\u2019re not just choosing the lesser evil. You\u2019re making a choice that brings you closer to the future you want to see.",

        "selftext":"Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented with helpful resources. I contacted the League of Women Voters, who helped me discover that I am actually eligible for a limited ballot! I cast my vote this morning :)\n\nSeveral months ago, my relationship came to an abrupt end due to domestic violence.\n\nI had to move 250 miles away from the city I called home for 12 years, back in with my parents. I have been making an effort to spend quality time with my aging and sickly mother while I'm here, in spite of how unhappy I am with the environment and circumstances that led me here. I took her out for lunch, and I was instantly rewarded by being pulled over on the way there. Rather than issuing me a warning (given that I was in an area that I'm unfamiliar with, had not yet seen a speed limit sign on the road I'd just turned on, was mirroring the speed of others around me, and in spite of the fact that people constantly drive recklessly at 90+ mph on the freeway I had just exited), I was issued a speeding ticket and a stern warning that I'm legally required to update my ID address within 30 days of moving.\n\nI had specifically held off on updating my address because I do not know how long I will be staying with my parents before finding a new place to live, and because I was worried that, due to how close to the election we are, it would interfere with my ability to vote. After the ticket, I felt pressured to update my address in case of legal consequences if I happened to be pulled over again (cops around here don't seem to do much other than treat citizens like piggy banks), so I caved and followed orders. I requested that my voter registration be updated at the same time, thinking that I was dotting my I's and crossing my T's.\n\nI showed up to the local polling station yesterday, completed practice ballot in-hand, and was told that I'm not eligible to vote in this election. I'm not eligible in my prior county of residence. I'm not eligible for statewide office votes that don't have anything to do with my county of residence. I'm not eligible to vote for the fucking president. NOTHING.\n\nI updated my address *one day* after the apparent deadline to be eligible to vote in this election. I've been registered to vote for over 10 years in a different county in the same state I've lived in my entire life, and I've never had an issue previously, so I was not as vigilant as I should have been. \n\nI'm angry at my ex for causing me to have to move. I'm angry at the cop for being a fucking cop. I'm angry at my state's voter registration requirements. I'm angry at myself for not reviewing the rules more closely. I'm just ANGRY, and there's nothing I can do except be better in the future.\n\n#TLDR; Please learn from my mistakes: either update your address *well* in advance, or risk it for the biscuit and leave it out of date long enough to submit your ballot.\n\n:(\n\nP.S. Yes, I'm in therapy already.",

Things were just so busy for me between work and my kids, I just didn't keep up with much of anything. I read some of the articles today about how it went.\n\nMy coworker has done nothing but go from conservative buddy to conservative buddy and just rage about what was said. Everything Harris does and says is wrong. Why watch at all?! It's self-flagellation at this point. Someone finally asked her where she gets her information from. \"I mean, I keep news on my phone all day long, I just listen to it on my headphones.\" Fox News. All day long. My alcoholic grandfather put himself in the grave doing the exact same thing.\n\nIn the last half hour or so, it's turned into \"both sides are going crazy.\" Yea...both sides.

        "selftext":"Sorry if this touches on points people have brought up before. It has been an issue I have been grappling with pretty hard recently, and wanted to know others thoughts. Seeing how damaging illiberalism has been recently in the world, with much of Europe and America seeing a rise in populism and authoritarian doctrine, I have been wondering what steps are necessary to combat this, even if they are illiberal, with a primary focus on the US bc american. The main issue is lies. Pure lies and misinformation. It is not even a debate that the majority of the right \\*relies\\* on, supports, and without issue, spreads lies and hate about certain populations. Espouse rhetoric for authoritarian nations, such as Russia, in order to weaken patriotism in the west\/US and bolster authoritarian candidates. \n\nIs it reasonable to make the proposition that limited illiberalism is necessary to protect liberalism? Should we impose laws and mandates on misinformation in the news and from online personalities to curb it? Is it reasonable to mandate that high-viewer personalities be required to publicly disclosed sources of financing, to show everyone who the primary funders of certain information points are? Should we limit people's ability to espouse rhetoric of fascism, specifically Nazis and supremacists? \n\nPersonally, I lean more towards yes. That these limited expansions of power and illiberalism are crucial to curbing the rise of authoritarianism in the west, and protecting liberalism in all other domains. I have no faith in the \"people\" or \"market\" in correcting these things. It ironically has just made it worse. People want fears validated, people want emotions represented. Lies and misinformation does this, and it pays well. The market encourages this rise. Sure, there are other sources pushing honesty, truth, and liberalism. But it hasn't been enough. \n\nWhat are we willing to give up to ensure the prosperity of freedom? \n\nI appreciate anyone who can provide thoughts and opinions, and give more examples of more things that could theoretically fall under more regulation, and those with valid arguments against so.

        "title":"Democrats emphasize policy and ideals vs results \/ impact too much. Democrats are also unwilling to highlight \"geographic wins\". ",
        "selftext":"I will preface this by saying that I realize that this is probably an unpopular opinion. I am also just explaining my experience. I'm a liberal Democrat living in a swing state in the Great Lakes region. My friends, family, and co-workers have a wide range of political beliefs and have various backgrounds. One interesting thing that I've noticed is that a lot of liberal Democrats have what I feel like is a warped view of what attracts people to Trump and the Republican party now a days. I'll admit that I had these same beliefs for a long time, but in talking to especially more a-political \/ moderate independents, it just doesn't seem to be holding up.\n\nOnline it seems like a lot of liberal Democrats think that it's just obvious that Democrats are the better choice economically for people who are not in the top 10% income wise. And pretty much better on every other quality of life issue. And therefore assume that any white a-political \/ independent \/ really anyone attracted to Trump and Republicans must be attracted to Trump due to his social policies and rhetoric on things like immigration, race, LGBTQ, etc.\n\nI think this is a huge disconnect between what Democrats think attract swing voters to Trump and what actually does. Pretty much all of the radio, tv, and print commercials I'm hearing \/ reading for Trump focus on the economy. \n\nAnother big thing is this idea that Democrats ruin the quality of life in a place. There seems to be a disconnect where Republicans talk about impact (often in an anecdotal way) \/ perceived quality of life and Democrats talk about policies \/ ideals and sometimes data (that is often disconnected from anecdotal impact). This leads to the whole geographic thing. I can't tell you how many times I've heard something like \"Kamala Harris is a Californian liberal. Liberals took states like California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania (I just saw a comment about liberals destroying Connecticut), etc., and have ruined them. \"Red states\" like Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Kansas, Tennessee, etc., are all doing so much better and they are doing better because of the people, policies, and politics. Democrats in turn tend to just try to either claim these red states as being more blue (or highlight blue cities in them) or say that the \"failing\" states are actually more conservative than people think. Or they might trot out a list of data showing \"blue\" states doing objectively better than \"red\" states. But Republicans are quick to say that basically all Red states that have negative data have negative data because of the Federal government and the civil war. At least where I live there is a pretty common belief (that trends across political beliefs) that the \"liberal\" states I mentioned are way worse than the \"red\" states I mentioned and that this due to the people, politics, and policies of those places (and that naturally\/historically those liberal places should be much better and the red places much worse). Also that while Republicans may control \"liberal\" states mentioned (and Democrats \"red\" states I mentioned), this doesn't overcome the idea that the \"liberal\" states are liberal (and their destruction rests at the hands of the Democrats) and the \"red\" states are conservative (and their success rests at the hands of Republicans). \n\n I have come across numerous people who say they dislike Trump and a lot of the Republican's messaging but that Republicans just govern better. I get that different personalities are attracted to different parties. And that it's more natural for Republicans to demonize entire states and cities than it is for Democrats. I also get that again probably due to the types of people the Democratic party attracts, Democrats tend to focus on data and policies \/ideology. I just wish that Democrats would start focusing how how Republicans have ruined the quality of life for average Americans in places that are both actually controlled by Republican politicians AND are considered \"red\" for the average American. Because Republicans are sure doing that in reverse and it's resonating a lot with swing voters. ",

Unfortunately, there appears to be a few Liberal identifying types who are taking it to heart. I don't know where these ideas are coming from, other than from Republican trolls, but I feel that it is completely unnecessary.\n\nWanting tthe freedoms enshrined in the US Constitution, to apply equally to all Americans, is not a matter of tolerance. It is a matter belief in the ideals of the Constitution.\n\nThere is no \"paradox of tolerance,\" because there is nothing to \"tolerate.\" You simply respect the freedoms of others. That's it. If they misbehave, you don't have to tolerate that misbehavior or come up with some wacky \"paradox of tolerance\" to explain it. It is completely unnecessary.\n\nSo, can we all let this \"tolerance\" stuff die now? I just want to get back to expressing my vicious intolerance of bigotry again.\n\n*Edit*\n\nThanks to the kind words and patience of u\/Bgc931216 and u\/raistlin65,  I think I have resolved this issue for myself at least:\n\nWe can choose what we will and will not tolerate. Tolerating one thing doesn't require tolerating all things. \"Selective tolerance\" is valid. So we can selectively tolerate the things in which our iLiberal ideology protects, while employing zero tolerance for the behaviors it does not protect.\n\nI still don't like the word tolerance, but this is good enough for me.",

        "selftext":"TL;DR: Phone banking can be fun and effective! Give it a try.\n\nThis is a write up of  my second phone bank.  You can read a bout the first here: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KamalaHarris\/comments\/1ewbg5z\/how\\_i\\_did\\_a\\_phonebank\\_for\\_the\\_democrats\\_and\\_how\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KamalaHarris\/comments\/1ewbg5z\/how_i_did_a_phonebank_for_the_democrats_and_how\/)\n\n**Finding a phone bank**: Go to\u00a0[https:\/\/events.democrats.org\/?event\\_type=2&amp;show\\_all\\_events=true](https:\/\/events.democrats.org\/?event_type=2&amp;show_all_events=true)\u00a0and find a phone bank and time that works for you. Sign up and you\u2019ll get a Zoom link to join when the session starts.\n\n**Training**: My call (and I believe every call) starts with a training session on how to use the dialer software and how to preview the suggested script for that calling session.  This session was calling voters in PA so the callers let us know ahead of time that some folks might be Trump supporters in case anyone got gruff with us.  We were advised to always be polite and not argue.\n\n**Calling**: They used a website called Scale To Win for the calls. I dialed directly from my browser using the site. I\u2019d recommend using a laptop\/desktop for this, but a tablet should work as well.  I used my laptop and headphones and it worked great.  \n\nCallers didn\u2019t see my name or my phone number. A tone would signal that a new caller had picked up and I\u2019d start the script, pressing items for responses, such as if I\u2019d gotten the right person (the software had the first name of who I was calling), if they were supporting Kamala Harris or not, etc.\n\nThe end goal for this calling session was to see how folks were voting, and to encourage Kamala supporters to volunteer.  Potential volunteers would receive a follow-up call.  I actually had a few who wanted to volunteer and others who said that work\/life didn't give them time, although they were voting for Harris.\n\nThere were a lot of hang ups, and voice mails, but the only \"angry\" person was actually a Kamala voter who was just sick of getting so many calls.  I feel for folks that live in swing states!\n\nAbout 10 minutes before the session ended, we joined back on our Zoom call for a debrief.  We also had a short form to fill out about what was front-of-mind for voters (it was inflation on my calls). Some folks had questions and suggestions, but mostly it was positive feedback.\n\nGive it a try. I\u2019ll be doing another phone bank soon. My goal is to do at least one a week until the election, hopefully more.",

Or what if he stepped down and let Harris be president so she can use her supreme court given authority to stop it?\n\nThe sc did it with Bush V Gore, but gore willingly stepped down, I pray Harris doesn't make the same mistake. I know we want to be the party of order, but at the same time we can't let them cheat.\n\nI know in the past they've ruled that electors can't cheat, but who the fuck knows anymore what they'll do after the immunity ruling, and R v w.\n\nIt's like they think they have more power than the president and are the true rulers of the country.",

        "selftext":"I've seen in a lot of comments, and heard from some friends in real life as well, opinions that are very negative about Kamala's experience as a district attorney and then attorney general. Basically anyone claiming \"Kamala was a cop\".\n\nLooking into this, I did a lot of research and wanted to share just some of the things I found. First, I think it's important to acknowledge that being a prosecutor is a tough job, one that deals with tough moral situations, especially as part of a social justice system that is often biased and unfair. I doubt there's a prosecutor in the country who I agree with as a liberal on every decision. But despite this, prosecutors obviously serve a crucially important role in any legal system. And it is really simply incorrect to claim that Kamala was just \"a cop\", or inherently or entirely illiberal in her legal record.\n\n  \n1. Harris had a liberal record for the time on marijuana prosecution. While DA of San Francisco, her office's policy [was to not seek jail time for mere possession](https:\/\/www.marijuanamoment.net\/trump-claims-harris-jailed-thousands-and-thousands-of-black-people-over-marijuana-but-her-actual-record-as-a-prosecutor-is-more-nuanced\/). Only a handful of people were jailed for possession under her tenure, most probably for extenuated issues. \n\nOf course, since then the Biden-Harris administration [reclassified marijuana](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2024\/04\/30\/1248205659\/marijuana-reclassify-biden-less-restrictions) and she's the first mainstream [presidential candidate to be pro-legalization](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/dariosabaghi\/2024\/07\/22\/where-does-kamala-harris-stand-on-marijuana\/).\n\n2. One of Harris' biggest initatives as DA was \"Back on Track\", which provided housing, job training, and substance abuse treatment for nonviolent offenders charged with drug possession. [The program was really successful](https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/opinion\/voices\/2020\/08\/10\/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column\/3334668001\/), greatly reducing the rate of re-offenses, and [saved tax payers money](https:\/\/bja.ojp.gov\/sites\/g\/files\/xyckuh186\/files\/Publications\/BackonTrackFS.pdf). In the end, it was so successful that other cities around the country like [Baltimore](https:\/\/www.baltimoresun.com\/2015\/05\/14\/mosby-new-program-gives-nonviolent-offenders-a-second-chance\/) and Philly copied it as well.\n\n3. She's always been consistently against the [death penalty](https:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/campaign\/466546-harris-campaign-releases-ad-on-opposition-to-death-penalty\/). As [written in 2004](https:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/politics\/article\/New-D-A-promises-to-be-smart-on-crime-Harris-2831205.php) when she was elected to SF DA: \"Harris has pledged to continue Hallinan's practice of supporting patients receiving medical marijuana, refusing to seek the death penalty and prosecuting three-strike offenders only for serious or violent felonies.\" \n\n\"It takes much more than building prisons and locking away prisoners to keep our city safe,\" Harris said.\n\n4. As AG, she created a [new division and initiative](https:\/\/oag.ca.gov\/news\/press-releases\/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-initiative-reduce-recidivism) to help first time offenders reintegrate in society and avoid repeat crimes. She also [refused to enforce Prop 8](https:\/\/www.nbcbayarea.com\/news\/local\/harris-vows-to-abandon-prop-8\/1860319\/), the ban on gay marriage on California eventually declared unconstitutional. \n\nFor more, see: [Public defender: I worked with Kamala Harris. She was the most progressive DA in California](https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/opinion\/voices\/2020\/08\/10\/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column\/3334668001\/).\n\n**Now, who did Harris really prosecute hard? Large corporations, polluters, and banks.**\n\n5. She [fought for big banks to pay $20 billlion to California home owners during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and won](https:\/\/fortune.com\/2024\/07\/22\/kamala-harris-jamie-dimon-settlement-california-homeowners-big-banks-financial-crisis\/).\n\n6. She also won a $1.1 billion settlement [from a predatory for-profit school](https:\/\/oag.ca.gov\/news\/press-releases\/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-obtains-11-billion-judgment-against-predatory): \u201cFor years, Corinthian profited off the backs of poor people \u2013 now they have to pay. This judgment sends a clear message: there is a cost to this kind of predatory conduct,\u201d said Attorney General Harris. \u201cMy office will continue to do everything in our power to help these vulnerable students obtain all available relief, as they work to achieve their academic and professional goals.\u201d\n\n6. She pushed for the [passage of the Homeowner's Bill of Rights in California](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/calif-attorney-general-kamala-harris-fights-for-struggling-homeowners\/), and won [hundreds of millions](https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/la-fi-suntrust-mortgage-settlement-20140618-story.html) back for homeowners from banks for multiple abuses.\n\n7. She recovered [hundreds of millions](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/sanfrancisco\/news\/california-to-receive-hundreds-of-millions-in-bank-of-america-settlement-mortgage-kamala-harris-department-of-justice\/) for state pensions from Bank of America who mismanaged their investments in 2009. \n\n8. She won $[241 million from ](https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/la-xpm-2011-may-20-la-fi-quest-settlement-20110520-story.html)a company overcharging Medi-Cal, and [$323 million from another](https:\/\/legalnewsline.com\/stories\/510527871-harris-323m-scan-settlement-record-recovery-for-calif-program). \n\n9.

        "selftext":"When I interact with people that claimed to be liberal or democrat, but heavily oppose VP Kamala Harris I become very suspicious of their political beliefs\/views. So here is why. \n\nI almost never start off a political discussion with my party affiliation. I live in a swing state and since the beginning of time it had always been red. Telling someone I am a Dem\/Lib is a good way to shoot my own-self in the foot! As we approach the presidential election it\u2019s a popular topic of conversation. It\u2019s one I avoid whenever possible. However, I\u2019ve notice lately an increase in people saying \u201cI\u2019m democrat\/liberal\/progressive, and I\u2019m not voting for her.\u201d Again where I live, you don\u2019t tell people your affiliation. You just start shit talking the other candidate or put a bumper sticker on your car and bitch about gas prices! IMO Kamala Harris is no brainer. So, am I party blind? Or are Dems\/liberals suddenly coming out of the closet. Seeing something about KH I\u2019m not? I just don\u2019t put anything past MAGA. I could see them party switching to pull a vote from KH! ",

        "selftext":"Ah, globalization! That grand economic experiment where we were told that free markets would lift all boats, make us all richer, and turn the world into one big happy trading family. At first, it worked. Trade flourished, economies grew, and capitalists popped champagne. But here\u2019s where things get tricky.\n\nWhat tends to happen next is less of a fairy tale and more of a thriller. Once firms grow large enough to wield the magic wand of global supply chains, they begin an efficiency quest. Labour, once a stable and locally anchored force, becomes a game of arbitrage\u2014moving from high-wage economies to lower-cost regions. At first, this boosts corporate profits and consumer purchasing power (who doesn\u2019t love cheap gadgets?). But soon enough, it triggers a paradox: the same workers who benefited from cheaper goods suddenly find themselves out of a job because their own wages are now \u201ctoo expensive\u201d compared to, say, a factory in Vietnam or a call center in the Philippines.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a novel observation. Dani Rodrik, in\u00a0*The Globalization Paradox*, argues that nations must choose two out of three:\u00a0**democracy, national sovereignty, and hyper-globalization**\u2014but never all three at once. When companies chase cheap labour worldwide, it weakens the social contract at home, destabilizing domestic politics. Karl Polanyi, way back in\u00a0*The Great Transformation*, predicted that unregulated markets would eventually provoke a political backlash. Sound familiar?\n\nAs globalization speeds up, firms consolidate. Economies of scale mean that once an industry starts outsourcing, the biggest players outgrow competition at an alarming rate. What we\u2019re left with isn\u2019t the efficient free market of Adam Smith\u2019s dreams, but rather a handful of corporate behemoths who shape industries, dictate wages, and set the rules. It\u2019s not capitalism eating itself\u2014it\u2019s capitalism evolving into oligopoly.\n\nAnd here\u2019s where things get dark. Economic distress fuels political instability. Laid-off workers, unable to transition fast enough to new jobs, don\u2019t stay quietly unemployed. They get angry. They vote. And not for centrists promising nuanced economic policy\u2014no, they turn to populists, strongmen, and \u201cdisruptors\u201d who promise to break the system that failed them. Protectionism rises, economic nationalism takes over, and before you know it, the world is no longer discussing trade deals but trade wars. Worse still, history suggests economic dislocation is one of the key ingredients for actual wars (see: the 1930s).\n\nSo here\u2019s my question to you, fellow Redditors and armchair economists:\u00a0**Is there a way for economics to self-correct before it spirals into geopolitical disaster? Can we design policies that maintain competitive markets while preventing the economic distortions that lead to instability and war?**\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts\u2014before the next financial crisis or world conflict proves the theory right.",

No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.\n\n&gt;Section 2. This Article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress.\n\nThen the [Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) states:\n\n&gt;But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\n\nIt seems rather clear that a President cannot *run* for POTUS after two terms and they are not eligible for being vice president.  I think this sets three scenarios for Trump becoming President a third time.  \n\n**Option 1:** He still runs as President a third time and this may be considered an \"official act.\"  Yes, it's technically against the US Constitution, Amendment 22, but who would be able to stop him if he's legally protected? \n\n**Option 2:** Trump runs for Speaker of the House in 2028, supporting the two others for President and Vice President on the Republican ticket.  They resign after being sworn in and Trump becomes President again.\n\n**Option 3:**  The SCOTUS could look into the ratification since you need 75% of states to agree to the amendment.  We could see that some states \"pull\" their submissions, enough to put it under the threshold or challenge the legality of the original submission.  The SCOTUS takes the case and makes it legal for them to pull their requests, the amendment gets dissolved.  \n\nWhich option do you think Trump would take?  Are there any more possibilities that Trump could try for a third term?",

If the voters approve of the bill, it remains a law, if they don't, it is repealed. Different places have different rules on whether or not the law is provisionally valid pending the vote or not, and how many signatories it takes and how long they have to collect them, in the 23 American states with them it varies from 1.5% in Massachusetts to 15% of the ballots in the last election, and usually 90 days to collect signatures from the end of the session. Switzerland is a prolific user of this mechanism, and in Switzerland, there is no such thing as a court finding a law unconstitutional, the people alone decide whether or not to uphold a law or not.\n\nIt could also be incorporated into the way it combines with an executive veto. Iceland's president's veto over bills takes the form of referring the bill to the population to vote on whether or not to sustain the bill. This has been used a couple of times, notably in the Icelandic debt crisis where voters were referred a bill on a restructuring plan and was massively defeated with 98% of the voters opposing the bill with 62% turnout. In Argentina, if the president vetoes a bill, and the congress can't get 2\/3 support in both houses to override but can get majority support, the bill goes to a referendum for judgement.

        "selftext":"We are three weeks into the Trump administration and there are already claims of potential constitutional crises on the horizon.  The first has been the Trump administration essentially impounding congressional approved funds.  While the executive branch gets some amount of discretion, the legislative branch is primarily the one who picks and chooses who and what money is spent on.  The second has been the Trump administration  dissolving and threatening to elimination various agencies.  These include USAID, DoEd, and CFPB, among others.  These agencies are codified by law by Congress.  The third, and the actual constitutional crisis, is the trump administrations defiance of the courts.  Discussion of disregarding court orders originally started with Bannon.  This idea has recently been vocalized by both Vance and Musk.  Today a judge has reasserted his court order for Trump to release funds, which this administration currently has not been following.\n\nThe first question, does any of this matter? Sure, this will clearly not poll well but is it actual salient or important to voters?  Average voters have shown to have both a large tolerance of trumps breaking of laws and norms and a very poor view of our current system.  Voters voted for Trump despite the explicit claims that Trump will put the constitution of this country at risk.  They either don\u2019t believe trump is actually a threat or believe that the guardrails will always hold.  But Americans love America and a constitutional crisis hits at the core of our politics.  Will voters only care if it affects them personally?  Will Trump be rewarded for breaking barriers to achieve the goals that he says voters sent him to the White House to achieve?

College educated people and young men have also shifted to the right. They didn\u2019t all go for Trump overall but they still shifted to the right compared to previous years. \n\nCities and their suburbs, traditionally Democratic strongholds, have begun voting more Republican too. This could be important as rural America is shrinking quickly and more people are flocking to urban and suburban areas. By 2050, 89% of the American population is projected to live in urban\/suburban areas, up from 83% right now.

Why has this legal protection allowed events such as the Right-wing Unity March in Charlottesville in 2017, where neo-Nazis and white nationalists paraded with torches chanting slogans such as 'Jews will not replace us,' to take place without prior restrictions? How is it possible that in multiple U.S. cities, demonstrations by groups like the Ku Klux Klan or the neo-Nazi militia Patriot Front are allowed, while in countries like Germany, where Nazism had its origins, hate speech, including the swastika and the Nazi salute, has been banned?\n\nThroughout history, the U.S. has protected these expressions even when they generate social tension and violence, as happened in the 1970s with the Nazi Party of America case in Skokie, Illinois, where the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the right of neo-Nazis to march in a community of Holocaust survivors. Why does U.S. law not prevent the display of symbols such as the swastika, the Confederate flag, or the Nazi-inspired 'Sonnenrad' (sun wheel), despite being linked to hate crimes? What role do factors such as lobbying by far-right groups, the influence of political sectors that minimize the problem of white supremacism, and inconsistent enforcement of hate crime laws play in this permissiveness?\n\nIn addition, FBI ([2022](https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/hatecrimes\/hate-crime-statistics-2022)) ([2023](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/us\/us-violent-crime-decreased-2023-hate-crimes-rose-fbi-reports-2024-09-23\/)) studies have pointed to an increase in white supremacist group activity and an increase in hate crimes in recent years. Why, despite intelligence agencies warning that right-wing extremism represents one of the main threats of domestic terrorism, do these groups continue to operate with relative impunity? What responsibility do digital platforms have in spreading supremacist ideologies and radicalizing new members? To what extent does the First Amendment protect speech that advocates racial discrimination and violence, and where should the line be drawn between free speech and hate speech?\n\nI ask all this with respect, with no intention to offend or attack any society.

However, both instances led to backlashes that have led to an environment that is arguably worse than it was before.  In 2008 Obama was the first black president one a massive wave of hope for racial equality and societal reforms.  This led to one of the largest political backlashes in modern politics in 2010, to which  democrats have yet to fully recover from.  This eventually led to birtherism which planted some of the original seeds of both Trump and MAGA. The second massive political push promoting diversity and equality was in 2018 with the modern woman election and 2020 with racial equality being a top priority.  Biden made diversifying the government a top priority.  This led to an extreme backlash among both culture and politics with anti-woke and anti-DEI efforts.  This resent contributed to Trump retaking the presidency.  Now Trump is pushing to remove all mentions of DEI in both the private and public sectors.  He is hiding all instances that highlight any racial or gender successes.  His administration is pushing culture to return to a world prior to the civil rights era.  \n\nThis leads me to my question.  Will there be a backlash for this?  How will it occur?  How can democrats lead and take advantage of the backlash while trying to mitigate a backlash to their own movement?  It seems as though every attempt has led to a stronger and more severe response.  \n\nAdditional side questions.  How did public opinion shift so drastically from 2018\/2020 which were extremely pro-equality to 2024 which is calling for a return of the 1950s?",

A lot of the attention has been focused on how young and inexperienced these techies are and how they might not understand what they are doing to the inner workings of the departments they are reviewing.\n\nBack in 2009, after Barack Obama came into office, a much different media environment existed where the flock of young staffers, policy gurus and even techies from what was then a mostly Democratic Silicon Valley, were praised and given supportive backing by many of the same journalist outlets.

We can increase retirement age (I've seen ideas of canceling pensions completely), introduce migrants as taxpayers (this is causing a lot of arguments and fuels conservative parties), or just kind of wait for 50 years to \"ride the wave\" of changing demographics, which to me seems rather ineffective.\n\nWould love to hear some opinions on this matter.",

The Boule had hundreds of members chosen by lot (having been elected in big batches, drawing some of those elected to the Boule) and this functioned as the governing senate of Athens. Juries of 201, 501, 1001, and 1501 people were also common, with the presiding magistrate also chosen by lot. They viewed elections as a risky way to govern a polity given that people could be bribed or intimidated to vote a certain way or otherwise to elect people who were risky people, but nobody could bribe the gods to choose one person over another in the drawing of lots, and an assembly of hundreds of people with time and ability to deliberate and seek information could make decisions likely to be representative of the whole people and not concerned over the short term political wish to be reelected or to otherwise climb in power.\n\nIn the modern era, we have juries, with jurors who are biased struck from the pool before the trial commences, but that isn't the only opportunity to use random chance. Some countries have turned to the idea of lottery to choose a large panel of people to deliberate on issues where it is seen that politicians might not be so good at, especially issues related to the rules of how politicians get put in office in the first place. In British Columbia, 19 years ago, a citizens assembly recommended a voting reform that was put to referendum and agreed to by 57% of voters, but the threshold had been set at 60% which was widely denounced as unconstitutional and illegitimate given that no such threshold was used to put the current system of voting into place and so why could it be legitimate to need 60% to change it? \n\nIreland used a citizens assembly to consider several issues, pertaining to whether snap elections can happen and if so how, how climate change reactions could occur, abortion laws, how pensions could be dealt with, and a few other things. They did divide over a few issues, but many votes actually had quite strong consensus. For months, they listened to people who presented their views, including experts, members of the public, affected people, members of the government, etc. \n\nIn principle, a citizens assembly could be given the power to compel information too from witnesses and to compel evidence too, or to demand a government official testify under oath on pain of perjury for lying or misleading them. Maybe they could do a budget analysis and plan and suggest that to the legislature or executive. They rarely have the power to make a binding decision of policy, but they may have their recommendation referred to a legislature or executive or the people for ratification. Maybe they could even be a third house of a legislature, even if it is more advisory or its decisions need approval by the people or the other houses to become policy or law. ",

In 2020 the turnout rates were very similar and by 2024 American turnout was actually quite a bit higher than British turnout for the first time in recent history.\n\nThe same thing also goes for midterms, the last two midterms have had the highest turnouts in recent history compared to the Obama era midterms for example.

Peters is 66 and led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for the last two cycles, so his retirement was unexpected. Coming on the tail of a Trump victory in Michigan, this means we'll have yet another nominal battleground Senate race next year on top of Jon Ossoff's bid for reelection in Georgia. Peters was first elected in 2014 in a landslide, right in the middle of a massive Republican wave. He was reelected in 2020 by a little more than a point and a half, defeating now-Rep.

Mallory McMorrow, and [former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg](https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2025\/01\/28\/pete-buttigieg-michigan-senate), a recent Michigander who's \"taking a serious look\" at the race.\n\nOn the Republican side, the party is once again looking at Rep. James, although it's possible he may run for Governor or seek reelection to his House seat instead. State Senate Minority Leader [Aric Nesbitt has already announced his bid](https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/michigan-governor-republican-aacf430c69c71d00e85dfe02b8829bbd), and former GOP gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon - who lost to Whitmer in a landslide in '22 - is also considering jumping in.

Songs like Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\", Edwin Starr\u2019s \"War\", and The Beatles\u2019 \"Revolution\" became anthems for change, speaking directly to the injustices of the time \u2014 civil rights struggles, the Vietnam War, and economic inequality. These songs echoed a collective desire for progress and a better future.\n\nFast forward to today, and many members of the Baby Boomer generation\u2014the very ones who helped create this powerful music\u2014are now among the most ardent supporters of Donald Trump. This is especially striking considering how much of the political activism and social consciousness of the 60s and 70s was a direct reaction to authoritarianism, injustice, and the excesses of the elite.\nSome examples of iconic political songs from that era:\n\n\t\u2022\tBob Dylan \u2013 \"The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019\" (1964): This song captured the essence of the 1960s political shift, urging people to embrace change and fight for justice.\n\n\t\u2022\tEdwin Starr \u2013 \"War\" (1970): A powerful anti-Vietnam War anthem that called out the horrors of conflict and questioned the motives behind it.\n\n\t\u2022\tThe Beatles \u2013 \"Revolution\" (1968): A song that challenged the status quo and called for a revolutionary change, reflective of the broader counterculture movements of the time.\n\n\t\u2022\tBuffalo Springfield \u2013 \"For What It\u2019s Worth\"(1966): A protest song addressing the social unrest and growing tension in the country, often interpreted as a critique of government repression.\n\nThese songs weren\u2019t just catchy tunes; they were calls to action, social commentary, and even direct criticism of the establishment.\nSo, here\u2019s the question: How did a generation that pushed for progressive political change through their music end up aligning with a political figure whose rhetoric and policies seem to contrast so starkly with the values of the 60s and 70s?\n\nIs it a case of cultural nostalgia clouding their judgment? A result of shifting political landscapes? Or has there been a fundamental change in values and priorities within this group?\n\nHow can the generation that created and embraced these songs now support someone like Trump?

Note that meritocracy differs significantly from socialism, since socialism\/marxism provides equality for everyone, regardless of their wealth or talent. But meritocracy favors talent over wealth. It agrees with socialism on disregard for inherited wealth, but argues people should be given opportunities based on their \"merit\", which is talent, intelligence, or even beauty. I believe the idea is romanticized in many cyberpunk settings, such as Metropolis (1927) and The Matrix (1999); dystopian societies where rich people are rewarded and poor, talented people are discriminated. It criticizes both capitalism and marxism.\n\nProblem 1: Who determines who's worthy and who's not? Government? Corporates? And who chooses them?\n\nProblem 2: What defines \"merit\"? What is the standard of being intelligent\/talented?\n\nProblem 3: How can we make sure corruption does not happen, and reach true meritocracy?\n\nProblem 4: Should genetic traits such as intelligence, strength, and beauty only be rewarded, or acquired traits such as hard work should be too?\n\nPart B: If it's possible, is it a good thing?\n\nLet's say somehow, we get close to the idea of true meritocracy. But is this a good thing for a society? If you're good in something, you'll be rewarded. But people with average intelligence\/capability will have many challenges. Maybe we can work on giving the \"average\" citizen a descent, livable life; but even then, is it moral?\n\nPros:\n\n\\- Talentless rich people are given the same starting point as talented poor people, where the latter can shine.\n\n\\- If hard work is rewarded too, then only you decide your fate. There is no excuse for poverty.\n\n\\- If done correctly, social injustice rarely happens. Everyone gets what they \"deserve\". Good people live well, average people live averagely, and bad people live badly.\n\nCons:\n\n\\- \"Talentless\" people, whatever defines that, will live harshly. They're humans too.\n\n\\- What happens to families' legacies if there is no inheritance?\n\n\\- The society needs constant monitoring and control, where corruption can happen easily.",

The most important besides judges would be the cabinet members.

        "selftext":"Losing the 2020 election might have been a blessing in disguise for Trump and MAGA, as they are as powerful as ever in the GOP and the country. The 2020 election was closer than expected, and if Trump had won 100,000 more votes in four swing states, he would have won a second consecutive term.\n\nWhen Trump unexpectedly won in 2016, he and the MAGA movement were relatively weak within the GOP and had no plan for government. Therefore, the GOP establishment subcontracted the cabinet, many legislative proposals, and judicial nominees. Trump\u2019s first cabinet included Mike Pompeo, Jeff Sessions, Bill Barr, and John Bolton. Paul Ryan drafted the laws that Trump enacted, such as the tax cuts. Mitch McConnell and the Federalist Society handpicked the judicial nominees.\n\nIf Trump had won in 2020, there would have been no January 6 moment where those Republicans disloyal to Trump, such as Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, Mitt Romney, as well as the other never-Trumpers, were excommunicated from the party. This would mean that MAGA's influence in the GOP had some opposition. Additionally, Trump would not have been under criminal investigation in several jurisdictions which fired up the base. More importantly, Trump had four years to plan for government this time; see Project 2025 and Agenda 47.\n\nAdditionally, Trump would have presided over the post-COVID inflation surge; hence, the GOP may have struggled in 2022 and lost the presidency in 2024 (Trump would have been term-limited hence the GOP nominee would have been someone else). This may have been the moment when the establishment Republicans took back control of their party from MAGA.\n\nNow, the GOP is firmly under Trump\u2019s and MAGA's control. Additionally, Trump\u2019s ban on social media after January 6 indirectly led to Musk buying Twitter. Big tech has shifted in favour of Trump, which may not have happened if Trump had won in 2020.\n\nSo, to what extent was losing in 2020 a blessing in disguise to Trump and the MAGA movement?",

Anyways I\u2019m genuinely curious and want to know what my fellow Conservatives think. What\u2019s the point of Trump negotiating a peace treaty in Ukraine if he doesn\u2019t plan on America doing anything in any case? You would assume if America\u2019s negotiating we\u2019d be somewhat involved be it with sending troops to help administer a neutral zone or to guarantee Ukraine post-war but Trump has stated he does not intend for America do either or increase aid for Ukraine if the deal fails. If this is the case why even bother negotiating if we\u2019re not going to get involved no matter the outcome? For the sake of being world-police? Also why should Ukraine accept any deal they view unfavorable now if they know the U.S. won\u2019t support them even if they did sign the deal and why would Russia accept a deal if they know America won\u2019t aid Ukraine anymore even if they don\u2019t end the war? I just don\u2019t see any point in Trump negotiating if America doesn\u2019t have any involvement on the outcome, either just pull out and let them deal with it or actually have America involve itself in the outcome.\n\nEdit: added a random url because apparently we need attachments even if it\u2019s a discussion post, don\u2019t know what\u2019s that\u2019s about",

I'm heartily in favor of funding scientific research. This is limiting lab and equipment expenditures, a necessary part of that research. \n\nI'm not saying there aren't issues with the NIH that should be addressed. For one, there's loads of studies that we fund and the results arent made public. Publicly funded research should be required to be published. But this isn't addressing that. \n\nIf there's corruption, or conflict of interest issues, wouldn't requiring greater transpiracy of funds be the solution? And firing those that abuse it? Not this? \n\nIf its that we don't want to waste money on pointless studies, wouldn't a crack down and more clarified policy on what research can be funded be the solution?\n\nThe only other argument I've seen is that universities are cutting themselves a portion of this money. But do we know that, and if so, how? I've seen a couple of comments on YouTube videos from people allegedly in university administration positions saying the funds from the grants are razor thin and well accounted for.

        "title":"New Rules and Changes - And Brief Explanations",
        "selftext":"We have 2 new rules that may be consolidated or adjusted. You'll have to excuse my boomerishness, but with New Reddit and some other changes (I still prefer Old Reddit) some of what we used to do has shifted. Some of these thing I think can be coded, but I am learning how. Again, forgive my ignorance.\n\nAnyway, one major problem that we have had in the past is that videos, text posts, and image posts, if unchecked, were often troll posts that not only meant to mock us, but also intended to get us shut down. If some bad actors on alt accounts created racist memes to throw on our sub and we weren't diligent enough in taking them down, the sub could get shut down. \n\nThat is why we only allowed article posts from the subs inception, and it remained an unspoken rule. But things started shifting and there were little changes to posts that reddit made, and then new reddit happened and we mods just didn't adjust to the times perhaps? That's my excuse anyway.\n\nPeople started posting links in text posts, which I thought was a mistake and we tried to correct it, but it was just a pain in the ass. They started posting text commentary under articles, which never used to happen.\n\nSo the issue is thus: too little oversight into posts leads to\n\n* Shit posts (And I mean shit)\n* Trolls having too easy a time to troll\n* Bad actors using bad posts to try and get us shut down or promote brigading that just ruins the experience of our users.\n\nThese new rules are to force commentary where it belongs, in the comment section. If you want to make a comment about your article, just make it in the comment section, don't change the title to comment on an article, and don't comment on the article in any body section (I think I changed that so you won't be able to).\n\n**Forcing the commentary into the comment section allows you users to protect from the problems that that causes while allowing for the** ***same*** **commentary**. So do not complain about free speech on this front. Protestors have to follow rules, too, they are supposed to get permits, they are not allowed to just disrupt everything... at least anywhere other than blue cities.\n\nThis also prevents an annoying trend I've been seeing where users post a link to Google. Not a Google article. Not some app on Google to comment on the app in some relevant way, just posting a link to Google so that they can then make a comment in what becomes a text post.\n\nHopefully I have removed that ability so the rule is moot.\n\nWe also hope to allow more things like text posts, video posts, and other posts. But that requires moderation. I can't tell you how many times such posts in the past were used to troll, brigade, and try to hurt us. An innocuous photo of Trump and the First Lady one posted here had a photoshopped silhouette of the twin towers on fire in the patter of Melania's dress or Trump's tie (I forget which). It was a troll post.\n\nThere may be setting changes to do some of this automatically (and I think there are, but I'm new to this part of moderating) so the rule doesn't even matter because it won't be possible to break these rules.\n\nThat said, I would also like you to know WHY we limit the kinds of posts we allow.",

Before the testosterone treatment, we found that weakly affiliated Democrats had 19% higher basal testosterone than those who identified strongly with the party (p=0.015). When weakly affiliated Democrats received additional testosterone, the strength of their party fell by 12% (p=.01) and they reported 45% warmer feelings towards Republican candidates for president (p &lt; 0.001).  Our results demonstrate that testosterone induces a \u201cred shift\" among weakly-affiliated Democrats.  This effect was associated with improved mood.  No effects were found of testosterone administration for strongly affiliated Democrats or strong or weak Republicans.  Our findings provide evidence that neuroactive hormones affect political preferences.",

        "selftext":"I covered leftist talking points in the last announcements (and I'll take that down once it seems the leftists, trolls, and bots have abated for the time being), but I wanted to discuss what it means to break our anti-Republican rule, along with our Reagan's 11th Commandment rule... because they are basically the same rule.\n\nI'm going to go through some common complaints we get from banned users and how to avoid being banned like those users.\n\n-**I was just stating a fact. What, FACTS aren't allowed anymore??**\n\nFacts are allowed. They have always been allowed and even encouraged. But if your fact is laced with commentary, then it is not longer \"just a fact\". Here are some examples.\n\n* **Fact**: The sky is blue.\n\n* **What gets you banned**: The sky is blue, you fucking fascist.\n\nTake note, because many do not notice the subtle difference between these two comments. Many who write something similar to the second comment will frequently in modmail say \"I was just stating a fact!\" This is so common, it's not funny.\n\nHere's another one:\n\n* **Fact**: Musk and Trump are uncovering a lot of fraud. While mistakes are being made, they are also being corrected, and Musk only has the power to report findings, not make final decisions.\n\n* **What will get you banned**: Musk and Trump, man... these guys are running amok. I'm deeply concerned about how Musk is just firing people.\n\nDo you see the difference? One is a fact, one is commentary and kind of half fact and half untruth. Many users do not see the difference. Be a user who does.\n\n-**Just because I don't suck Trump's dick means I'm anti-Republican! I have been registered Republican for [X number of] years!**\n\nThis is one we get a lot. You must understand that we are a large umbrella. There are MAGA Republicans. There are Trump supporters who love Trump for this time in history but want to see leadership arise that is a bit more conventional as a leader and a bit easier for moderates to swallow. There are Republicans who absolutely hate the current president and the direction of the party.\n\nWe don't care what category you fall under. What we care about is that you show deference to fellow party members.\n\nIf you don't like the memes of Trump, fine, but don't trash people who do. And if you think it makes us look bad, I would just point out that the left has called us racists and bigots for literally decades and we took it in stride. They memed us in the media constantly before memes were even a thing.The character assassination attempts they did to Trump, they also did to Romney, to McCain, to Bush Jr., to Bush Sr., they accused Clarence Thomas of rape just like Kavanaugh. This is the left's M.O. and it has been for longer than I've been alive, arguably since before the Civil War.\n\nYou don't have to like the memes President Trump posts or that we on the right are making and posting. I don't particularly like them myself. But to trash fellow Republicans for it, without giving any understanding to the fact that the left have memed us and called us racists and bigots for decades, is disrespectful to your fellow Republicans.\n\nYou can argue it makes us look bad. But do so with respect.\n\n* **What's acceptable**: I don't like this meme and doesn't think it helps our cause, but I can see why people find it funny and find it to be a valid answer to what the left has done to us for decades.\n\n* **What's not acceptable**: The MAGA's who suck Trump's dick love this shit, but it makes us look bad.\n\n*I would say to all the users who worry about looking bad to the left*: I know you care about looking bad to the left, but how about looking bad to your fellow party? Comments like the one just above make YOU look bad to ME and many of your fellow Republicans.\n\nShow respect.\n\n-**[Insert Prominent Republican's Name] is a piece of shit! He's a traitor to the party!**\n\nI am a Christian first, a member of my family second, an American third, and a Republican lower on the list. I hope all of your have a similar hierarchy. Political parties are not the be-all and end-all. \n\nPolitical parties are tools to pool votes in a coalition to create a platform that a large number of people with many varying views can get behind and vote for in the face of another party that is doing the same with views we largely disagree with. They have value in the situations, but I kind of hate that they exist.\n\nThat said, being a sub FOR the party (although we are not affiliated with the GOP in any official capacity, we are just fellow Republicans), we do need to show deference to the party, we need to respect the party, we need to respect the umbrella, and we need to respect the individuals in the party.\n\nI am not a fan of Romney but I respect that he is a Republican. So if I criticize him, I might have a little fun, but I won't just trash him. **Keep in mind, would you rather the left win, or have a [insert Republican you don't like]?** In my case, I'd rather have a Romney than an Obama.\n\n* **What is acceptable**: Romney doesn't feel all that Republican to me these days and I really don't like how he keeps breaking from Republicans on so many issues, to the point I'd call him a RINO. But he's a strong business man and I'd take him over Obama any day.\n\n* **What is not**: Fuck that loser Romney. He's a RINO piece of shit. I don't trust him.\n\nDo you see the difference? One way criticizes while showing solidarity with the party, the other way is making it difficult to have any solidarity because it's so disrespectful.\n\nWe need solidarity. That does not mean we accept \"traitors\" if indeed we have any, but that does mean that we do not treat our fellow Republicans like crap. We don't throw them to the wolves unless it is clear we must. We don't cast them aside unless the allegations against them are credible. If they are indeed a RINO, show the receipts, but be respectful.\n\nMatt Gaetz is a prime example. The right thing to do was to cut ties with him, but not before allegations were credible enough (especially knowing the left has made so many false accusations before). And also it should be done with the understanding that a lot of senators and congressman of all parties have likely been in a similar situation but just haven't been caught. He shouldn't have done what he seems to have done and it's inexcusable, but it also seems like a political targeting. Both of those things can be true at the same time.\n\nWe don't jump down a Republican's throat at the first accusation of impropriety, we let the facts come out and then deal with it appropriately. Getting hysterical about it from the first moment would lead to us not having Clarence Thomas or Brett Kavanaugh on the bench. We wouldn't have Trump. And think about how many it worked on. It worked on Romney, it worked on Bork (look him up), it worked on so many others. This is the left's MO. They tried to get rid of Hegseth because of a tattoo and baby clothes. Don't buy their hysterics, let the facts come out.\n\nI hope this clears things up.",

        "title":"Do Not Feed The Trolls and Leftists - a Few points to remember in this Strange and awesome time",
        "selftext":"First of all, we are being inundated, just like every time Trump wins or is impeached, or is shot at, by trolls, by curious left leaning folks, and I assume by bots.\n\n**Do not engage them. Report them.** I have seen too many posts or comments upvoted that a republican wouldn't upvote, or at least they wouldn't if they knew what was happening with that comment.\n\nI just banned a user who came in saying something that SEEMS righteous, but was an underhanded trashing of the right. \"We shouldn't label or call the left names, that is leading to divide.\" It sounds kinda nice, civility is important. None of us want war or violence or anything of the sort. But to come in here and act as if we are the uncivil ones indicates to me that you are either\n\n* a lefty posing as a Republican to bullshit us and try to underhandedly sway us in a pathetic, passive aggressive way\n* a Romney-esque Republican who has appeased the left far too much over the years while criticizing his own party far too much as well\n* or a Republican who doesn't have any idea how bad the USAID stuff is because you are listening far too much to media that has largely been coopted by the Democrats.\n\nBy the way, we do expect our users to be civil, but we also give our users some latitude in our sub because this is our place to discuss politics with fellow republicans. I would not expect people in the democrat subs to refrain from referring to us in derogatory ways. But still, there are lines, and if our users cross them, we will ban them.\n\nFolks, we try really really hard not to draw lines and define what a Republican is. The party is a large umbrella. There are libertarian republicans, there are republicans who are very conservative socially, there are republicans who are gay. There are Republicans who believe in abolishing the Fed, and ones who just want to reform it. There are republicans who are Muslim, Asian, black, hispanic even trans. And I have to give a special 'thank all' to all those minorities for voting Trump. It is so hard to go against the stranglehold the Democrats have had on minority voters for so long, I can't imagine how it feels to vote Trump when your whole family and everyone around you is saying you're a traitor or something. But you had the courage of your convictions and that is amazing.\n\nThere is room in the Republican party for so much. We are a huge umbrella.\n\nThat said, we have to draw the line sometimes. There are obvious lines. Like if you are a Republican Socialist.... sorry, you are not a Republican. I don't even care if you're legally registered republican. Socialists do not fit under our umbrella. We will ban you for espousing those views here.\n\nIf you are for mutilation of minors and are technically a republican, we will ban you for espousing those views here.\n\nWe have a rule that says \"No leftist talking points\" and we have that not because we are scared of leftist views (I mean look at how hard leftist views are failing ALL OVER THE WORLD... they're bad ideas). We have that rule because Reddit is 90% left and we hear their views all the time. There views are inescapable. We couldn't live in a bubble on reddit if we tried. I was just blasted on a design sub because someone posted what they thought was a clever design and it was basically a \"Trump is Hitler\" sign and I said \"Can this sub of all subs be non-political? Is that possible?\" I wasn't banned but I was told that when fascists aren't endangering our rights, then maybe they wouldn't HAVE to get political. Such wieners.\n\nThis leads to another reason for that rule. We were largely forced out of the \"neutral\" spaces long ago. Subs like r\/politics, r\/news, r\/worldnews. They are all run by leftists, and they are swarming with leftists who will down vote and berate anyone who comes in with even just a mildly conservative or pro-Republican idea (or in my case just a pro-neutrality comment). So we were largely forced out except for those \"Republicans\" who the hardcore leftists like because they say things that the lefties think are reasonable.\n\nIf you are a \"Republican\" who blames us for the bad rhetoric when for over 40 years we have been called Racists, Nazis, and bigots and for much of that time we took it in stride, then you are so deluded, you are not a Republican and we can't have you here because you are espousing leftist talking points.\n\nIf you are a \"Republican\" who blames us for the tension when we were being skipped over by FEMA for supporting Trump, then you are not a Republican and we can't have you here. You'll be banned for leftist talking points.\n\nIf you are a \"Republican\" who says \"Hey guys, let's chill and stop saying the Democrat party is corrupt as hell for using the FBI to target our candidates, for using the IRS to target conservatives, for pressuring their buddies in banking to not do business with conservatives, for using USAID to funnel money to the Democrats, for using the presidency to garner favor with China, for getting their buddies in big tech to censor us for challenging the Covid narrative (which we were literally right about on every count), for supporting and funding the BLM riots which destroyed so many small business and property\" then you are not a Republican and we can't have you here. Those are leftist talking points. And they are also absurd.\n\nWe consider people who blame us for the tension to be anti-Republican and spewing leftist talking points. But we do understand that some on our side do not help the situation. We will ban those who do so dangerously, but will we not ban people for using the typical names we call the lefties in our circles.\n\nWe don't expect users to lavish Republicans with praise, you can disagree with Republicans, you can call out Republicans for wrong doing, but do so with respect to your fellow republicans. And for Pete's sake, do not paint a false equivalency that the left and right are just as bad right now.\n\nI would ask our users again to help us by reporting those users and calling them out.\n\nMany of them will have comments that are upvoted because the lefties love swarming our sub, especially when they have so soundly been beaten.",

        "selftext":"Canada?? Why?\n\nFor several months Trump has floated the idea that Canada should join the USA as the 51st state. \nSo let\u2019s set aside the fact that Canada will never willingly do that. \n\nBut is it actually a good idea? \n\nThe population of Canada is just north of 40M, which is more than Cali. So adding them would give them more state representatives than Cali currently has and they would likely be mostly Democrats. If the House stayed at 435, that would mean that most states would lose representatives and some republicans would likely be replaced by Democrats. So this would make it harder for a Republican house to exist given how tight the House is right now. \nSame thing on the Senate. They would likely elect 2 DEM Senators, and again making it harder for GOP to hold the Senate. \nNow if they up the Reps that will make the GOPs situation worse since most of the new Reps would be DEMs. So instead an even(ish) split in the house, we might just have 40 new DEM and 10 new GOP reps. \n\nBut we probably wouldn\u2019t be adding Canada as one large state. It would make more sense to add each province as a state. Which wouldn\u2019t affect the Representatives much, but would widely swing the Senate DEM. Given that the 20 new Senators would like be 15 DEM to 5 GOP or similar. \n\nTrump trying to take ownership of Canada doesn\u2019t make answer sense if he wants to keep the Republican Party alive, let alone the MAGA republicans. \n\nI want to be clear, this isn\u2019t AntiTrump, I\u2019m just trying to figure out why we would do this given that it would likely swing the political pendulum to the Democrats, and possibly for a long time.

        "selftext":"\nNigel Farage is looking on in envy at Washington DC.\n\nIn Donald Trump\u2019s first two-weeks as President he began a programme of mass deportations, cut billions in government waste, leveraged tariffs on Mexico and Canada, removed top FBI officials, ended DEI in the federal government, and fired tens of thousands of government bureaucrats.\n\nStephen K Bannon, an ally of the President, described this period as \u201cdays of thunder\u201d. To many conservatives, President Trump has done more for their cause in two-weeks than a string of top Republican politicians have achieved in two-decades. One of the most successful initiatives has been the creation of the Department for Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, led by Elon Musk. Musk claims to have cut more than a billion dollars in spending every day, and has taken aim at various taxpayer-funded programmes, in particular those promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\n\nIf the coming weeks unfold as they have since Trump\u2019s inauguration, then no American president since Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s legendary first 100 days has done more to reshape the nation.\n\nSince the birth of the welfare state and FDR\u2019s transformative expansion of the US government in the 1930s\u2014marked by his controversial \u201calphabet agencies\u201d aimed at revitalising the economy after the Great Depression\u2014conservatives and libertarians have continuously fought against this revolution, championing small government instead. And ever since the 1930s the size of the government has only ever gone in one direction: It has grown. This was true under Democrat and Republican Presidents alike, including Ronald Raegan, and Donald Trump in his first term.\n\nThe government has become so bloated that the US national debt has reached $36.22 trillion, with its annual deficit standing at a whopping $1.8 trillion. Elon Musk has pledged to cut \u201ctrillions\u201d in waste and fraud, a lofty goal which will be difficult to reach. However, the Tesla CEO has already identified billions spent on programmes he says are surplus to requirement. These include the tens of billions spent on USAID to projects around the world, some of which are absurd.\n\nAmong the projects funded by American taxpayers via USAID are: $20 million for a Sesame Street show in Iraq, $70,000 for a DEI musical in Ireland, $2 million for Moroccan pottery classes, and $6 million to promote tourism in Egypt. DOGE has already cut down the agency\u2019s employees from more than 14,000 to just hundreds of critical staff, and Trump has tweeted promising to shut down the entire department.\n\nDOGE operates with Elon Musk at its head and a series of young men underneath him. Musk has 20 staff operating in DOGE, most of whom are men in their early 20s, including one who is just 19.\n\nThese men are equivalent to Dominic Cummings\u2019 \u201cmisfits and weirdos\u201d who worked in Number 10 during Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership. Musk believes he can hire autistic geniuses to work day and night to go through the federal budget with a knife. The team is using AI algorithms to search for waste, which is surely required when one takes into account the size of US government spending. One member of the team won a prestigious prize (worth hundreds of thousands of dollars) for using AI to translate ancient Roman texts which were previously believed to be unreadable. They have the political backing of the President and his Cabinet, as well as much of Congress. For the first time since the New Deal there seems to be a Republican President who meant it when he said he wanted a smaller, more efficient state.",

        "selftext":"Liberal here. I\u2019m looking for a civil and respectful discussion without the insults and name calling.\n\nThere\u2019s been many instances where I\u2019ve seen people, presumably conservative\/MAGA\/republican, comment on posts that Biden has screwed up the country or how badly he has done. However, they never elaborate on what they think was so bad. \n\nFrom my perspective I think he did a good job overall. As with every president I\u2019d say he handled some things were very well and some were very disappointing, but overall he was good. Just real quickly the very good things, in my opinion, were his economic recovery after COVID, curbing inflation, handling Ukraine, infvesting in infrastructure, and green initiatives. Very bad was the Afghanistan exit strategy and an overly aggressive strategy to move towards electric vehicles. \n\nI find Israel and Gaza\/Hamas very complicated and I honestly can\u2019t speak with confidence about either side, but I do feel Israel had\/has the right to defend themselves. Meanwhile a lot of innocent Palestinian civilians and children suffered needlessly.\n\nSo what did Biden do that was so horrible?",

Next, she needed to update the museum's website, logo and printed materials.

The Executive Branch is just enforcing the laws that are on the books, specifically Title 8. \n\nIf people want to change the laws on the books, why are they not protesting against the House of Representatives? The House is the branch that is charged with writing bills into law, so if people want to change the laws, they should be protesting against the Legislative Branch. \n\nAdditionally, why were there no protests against Obama when he was President? Obama deported 409,849 in 2012 alone. His administration deported more people in one term than Trump did in his first term. \n\nTo me, if there is so much momentum for immigration reform (which I agree that there should be reform) why is no one holding up signs calling out their local Congressman or Congresswoman?  This is an ideal time for Congress to use the support of the people to put forth a meaningful immigration reform law. \n\nThe last meaningful immigration reform was passed in 1996, which is almost 30 years ago. If people really wanted change they should step up and have Congress amend the law to reflect their opinions. Seems like common sense to me and is long overdue. \n\nNone of the interviews or people protesting in the  #50501 protests even mention their local elected officials, all the focus is on the Executive Branch.

Did you drop your brain into the toilet and forget to rinse it off before stuffing it back up your ass?  \n\nApparently this bit of \"wisdom\" flies in the face of something Liberals have been saying for years!  \n\nILLEGALS CAN'T VOTE\n\nSo how can a Latino who voted for Trump get deported if they're all US Citizens???\n\nTHEY CAN'T. \n\nI spoke to my barber this morning who said her college-aged Daughter came home frantically crying saying she needed to carry her birth certificate with her on campus because ICE was coming to college campuses and putting all brown people on buses.  She's a natural born US Citizen (her Mother is too, so she's not a Dreamer) who believes that Trump is deporting ALL Mexicans to Mexico!  \n\nCan you believe that shit? Trump has not ended DACA!  Dreamers are not being deported!  US Citizens are certainly NOT being deported!  \n\nUnless they are convicted criminals who have already served their jail time and are being protected by Sanctuary Cities that refuse to deport them.  \n\nThe shit that the Liberal media is putting out is outrageous.  The outright lies that the paid Liberal \"personalities\" on TikTok, Instagram, etc., are putting out is designed to keep these kids freaking the fuck OUT and reacting to one crisis after another without any let up.  That is literally how you radicalize someone!\" \n\nIf you're a parent of a teenage or college age student and you're NOT sitting down with them and walking them through everything that is happening, YOU'RE the problem too!  It's our job to teach our kids how to be independent thinkers and how to apply critical thinking and objective reasoning! If you're not, maybe YOU should be deported!",

We aren\u2019t being hateful, we aren\u2019t spreading \u201cdisinformation,\u201d and even try to included links to sources as often as possible. Reporting posts to the mods, and reporting mods to Reddit has not produced. Anyone have any knowledge on how mod bans\/removals work? Can we all join together in reporting these posts and mods to try to bring some normalcy back to our respective states Reddit pages?

Are we not all scared, struggling to make a better life in this world, desperate to save a country we fear has taken one too many wrong turns? A world with ever increasing violence and limited resources? The challenge of making an honest living? Each side has very different opinions on how to solve the issues, but what is terrifying is how polarized it has become. Can we not all agree that the system is broken? Is that not what the right believes Trump is doing? He is shaking things up so that the old system that has failed so many is destroyed. The left is clinging to the broken system for the few scraps it still provided because frankly, is not the alternative also terrifying? A new way of government opens the door to big change, and not necessarily for the better. Sometimes power is seized by those that will not hold any value in the plight of the nations' citizens. \n\nLook, I don't know what is the right path forward. The only thing I know is that we as a people, a nation, need to come together. God says to love your neighbor. Jesus spent most of his time with the lowest of society. If God was in our hearts, would we not embrace our fellow human? If care for human rights was the motivating factor for opposing a political viewpoint, would we not also care for the human rights of those whose hearts seem filled with hatred? This horrific division between right and left is just distracting us all from the real systemic issues. We are all struggling to make a living, why can't we work together to solve the problem? Why must we villainize each other? We are all afraid. We all want a better country, a better government. We all want a voice. Why do we silence each other?\n\nAs we enter this new era of change, let us remember that for better or worse we are in this together. We cannot ignore the pain and suffering of one half of the country, even if you think they are stupid, intolerant, spiteful, sensitive, despicable, or blind. It does not change what is. The choice we do have is how we treat our fellow humans every day. Jesus was persecuted and ultimately killed. The entire time he kept his heart open to the people harming himself and his friends\/followers. He did not perpetuate their hatred, and he loved them. God loves criminals, the sick, nonconformists, and those with hate filling their hearts. If you believe in God, follow his example. If you believe in human rights, make sure you don't play God and decide who is deserving of those rights. We are all in this together. ",

It comes after Trump suggested pairing aid to the liberal stronghold with a crackdown on noncitizen voting.\n\n\nTrump has made no secret of his intent to keep a close eye on the Republican majorities in the House and Senate this year, particularly as they discuss how to use their numbers to pass a massive conservative policy overhaul via the budget reconciliation process.\n\n\nBy reducing the threshold for Senate passage from 60 votes to a 51-seat simple majority, reconciliation allows a party in control of both congressional chambers to enact sweeping changes, provided they\u2019re relevant to budgetary and fiscal policy.\n\n\nA copy of lawmakers' schedule obtained by Fox News Digital shows a heavy focus on reconciliation this week, with several closed-door meetings on the matter scheduled for Tuesday.\u00a0\n\n\nJohnson also suggested on Monday that it could be a key part of Trump's speech as well.",

These were originally posted just days after January 6th on the original Donald Trump Subreddit, which was later banned. All the evidence of election fraud and January 6th being orchestrated by Antifa was wiped. (Mind you, that Subreddit, which contained so much proof and content, was never reinstated.)  \n\nWhen I saw platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google banning and censoring content, I decided to keep these videos as a record for the future. Now, I am finally part of the silent majority brave enough to post this. This evidence should have been used in court. The frustration I feel when I think about how big tech and the media erased so much proof, silenced us, and painted us as villains is overwhelming.  \n\nI compiled these videos taken by people on their phones during the January 6th Capitol \"insurrection.\" You\u2019ll see footage of people identifying Antifa members, following them, talking about them, and shouting at them as they broke windows, saying, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d and trying to stop them.  \n\nI\u2019ve also included videos of police officers appearing to guide people into the Capitol. Watching these, it\u2019s hard not to wonder if the insurrection was started by no one but the left itself, orchestrating chaos while mindless MAGA supporters unknowingly walked into the trap. I\u2019m posting this here so people can see for themselves and consider that maybe things weren\u2019t as black and white as CNN and other left-leaning media make it seem.  \n",
